} {} {nxtvepg} bold { is an X11 and Win32API application to decode, analyze and browse TV programme schedules transmitted on analog TV channels as defined in ETS 300 707: "Protocol for a TV Guide using electronic data transmission" by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.
} {} {The Nextview standard was developed for use in TV sets, but the data can be received and used in a PC, too - provided you have a Teletext capable TV tuner card and are lucky enough to have a Nextview content provider in your country.
} {} {nxtvepg} bold { enables you to obtain free TV programme listings for all of the major networks in Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland. Currently Nextview EPG is transmitted by the following TV networks (note that each of these EPGs cover not only the provider's programme but also that of many other networks):
} {} {In Germany and Austria: Kabel1, 3Sat, RTL-II.
} indent {In Switzerland: SF1, TSR1, TSI1, EuroNews.
} indent {In France: Canal+, M6, TV5, EuroNews.
} indent {In Turkey: TRT.
} indent {For up-to-date information check the nxtvepg homepage in the Internet (see the About popup in the Help menu). If you don't receive any of the channels listed above, you can only use the demo mode as described with the } {} {-demo} bold { command line option.

On Linux the given index is appended to the device names, i.e. } indent {/dev/vbi} {underlined indent} { and } indent {/dev/video} {underlined indent} { (see also } indent {Files} {href indent} {). On Windows index "n" means the n-th card found while scanning the PCI bus for cards with a supported capture chip (e.g. Brooktree Bt878, Bt878A, Bt848, Bt849, Philips SAA7134, Conexant 23881).  If you have more than one TV card with the same chip, the order between those is undefined, but still constant (i.e. the order is determined by the driver, not nxtvepg)

The -daemon option cannot be combined with the -noacq or -demo options.
} indent {The daemon always creates a named socket in the } indent {/tmp} {underlined indent} { directory (UNIX only) plus optionally a TCP/IP socket to allow connects by browser processes.

} indent {UNIX Warning: for security reasons it's depreciated to run the daemon with root privileges, because nxtvepg has not been reviewed yet for possible exploits. If you want to start the daemon already during system startup, you should use su(1).

} indent {-acqpassive} bold {
} {} {In daemon mode this option overrides the acquisition mode setting in the configuration file and forces the acquisition into passive mode (see } indent {Acquisition modes} {href indent} {).

set helpTexts(2) {{Getting started} title1 {
} {} {Before you can start reading in TV programme schedules (called } {} {acquisition} underlined { from here on), you have to do just a few configurations. Which ones depends on your setup and will be described in this chapter. As long as your browser window contains no data, there's also a recommondation how to get to data in the browser window, highlighted by a yellow background.
} {} {This manual describes all features of nxtvepg in detail. You do not have to read all of it at once to operate the software. However it's recommended to skim at least through } {} {Basic browsing} href {, } {} {Data acquisition} href { and } {} {Filtering} href {.
} {} {TV card Setup on M$ Windows} title2 {
} {} {Windows users first have to configure the driver for their TV card in the 'TV card input' dialog from the Configure menu (for additional information see also } {} {Configuration: TV card input} href {). UNIX users can skip this section.
} {} {To start card configuration, press the } {} {Configure card} underlined { button in the middle of the dialog window, which will open another dialog.  If no supported TV capture chips were found in your system, the button will be disabled.  In case you see a message claiming } {} {PCI scan failed} underlined {, this means the TV card driver could not be loaded.  In this case close all other video applications and try again or look up a detailed description of driver error messages in the README file.
} {} {First press the } {} {Autodetect} underlined { button to the right of the dialog window; this will read certain parameter values from non-volatile memory on your card (EEPROM) to determine the manufacturer and model.  Optimally this will allow to derive all required parameters automatically.  If this succeeds, all your card's parameters will be set and you're done and can close the configuration dialog with Ok.  If you wish you can still override automatically derived values (e.g. tuner type) with the options described below.
} {} {If you get a message that says the card, but not the tuner, could be determined you can skip the next paragraphs and continue with the manual tuner selection.
} {} {If your card type could not be automatically determined, search and select your card type in the listbox at the left and then press the } {} {Pick from list} underlined { button or double click on the listbox entry. Note: The card list is identical to the } {} {DScaler} bold { TV application (also very similar to } {} {K!TV} bold {); the same is true for the tuner list. Hence if you're unsure, the easiest way is to look up your configuration in DScaler and just copy it here.
} {} {For certain card types, the card is queried for the tuner type after manual card selection.  If this fails, you'll get a message and have to select the tuner manually.
} {} {To configure a tuner type, open the tuner selection popup menu by clicking on the } {} {Configure} underlined { button and select one of the entries.  For many cards the tuner type is printed on the outside of the retail packaging. Yet a better way is to read the tuner type from the metal shielding box on the card itself.
} {} {Some hints for figuring out your settings:  For many cards the selected card type is not relevant to nxtvepg (i.e. only tuner and for Bt878 cards the PLL).  Hence if you don't find your card in the list don't worry, just use any PAL or SECAM card entry in the list and set the other parameters manually.  To check your configuration start an EPG scan.  Before you do so you must leave the configuration sub-menu with OK so that the changes are applied.  For your convenience, you can open the card configuration dialog with a button in the EPG scan dialog window.
} {} {Hints for tuner selection: If you live in Germany, Austria or Switzerland you probably have a PAL tuner, in France it's one of the SECAM types. If you select the wrong tuner, you can have either no reception at all (the EPG scan will just run through and suggest to check your antenna) all or no reception just on a few channels.
} {} {For cards built around a Brooktree chip (Bt878 et.al.) the type of PLL initialization also needs to be set.  This setting is directly tied to your card selection, hence usually you will not need to set it manually. Usually the correct value for } {} {PLL initialization} underlined { with PAL and SECAM cards is either } {} {No init} underlined { or } {} {28 MHz} underlined {. (If you select the wrong value you have no reception at all.)
} {} {Video input configuration} title2 {
} {} {Before nxtvepg can start acquiring EPG data, it must be told if the video feed is provided by your TV card's internal TV tuner (if you're connected to your city's TV cable network or a terrestrial antenna) or an external source (usually satellite receivers connected via Composite or S-Video cable).  This can be configured in the } {} {TV card input} underlined { dialog in the Configure menu (for more in-depth information see also } {} {Configuration: TV card input} href {).
} {} {By default nxtvepg assumes input via TV tuner.  This is the preferred mode of operation, since nxtvepg can change channels between multiple Nextview providers, while with an external source you have to switch channels manually (see also } {} {Data acquisition} href {).  If you're living in France you should tell nxtvepg to use the French channel table (which implies using the Secam TV norm instead of PAL B/G/I); this information is required for the next step: the EPG scan.
} {} {If you cannot use the TV tuner but have instead connected a satellite receiver through the Composite or S-Video input, select the respective setting in the } {} {video input} underlined { drop-down menu.  Then close the dialog with Ok and open the aquisition mode configuration dialog from the same menu. There you should change to the } {} {external} underlined { mode: in this mode nxtvepg will switch to the configured video input channel during startup of acquisition, but afterwards expect you to tune in a Nextview provider's channel at the external video source. To load all provider's inventories in the way the EPG scan does, you have to tune in all provider channels (for a list see the intro of this manual or the Internet homepage) and wait until the status line changes from "starting up" to "working on".
} {} {Note that you can also connect your satellite receiver via antenna cable. However this  variant is highly depreciated, because the signal is often degraded so much that nxtvepg is not able to decode the EPG data stream any more.  But if you still want to go that route, you'd keep the tuner as input source and start an EPG scan to find the channel your receiver is transmitting its signal on.  Make sure to disable the } {} {Use .xawtv} underlined { option in the provider scan dialog, unless your satellite receiver's channel (i.e. the frequency onto which the satellite signal is modulated) is defined as an input channel in xawtv.  Before you start the EPG scan you need to tune in a Nextview provider's channel.  The scan will only find that one provider. If you want to load all providers you have to continue manually as described above.  For an acquisition mode it's recommended to stay with } {} {Follow browser database} underlined {. Although nxtvepg will not be able to actually "follow" your provider selection with the acquisition since it can't switch the TV channel at your external input, this mode will tell nxtvepg to set the TV tuner onto your receiver's channel (see also } {} {Acquisition modes} href { for more details.)
} {} {EPG scan: Search for Nextview providers} title2 {
} {} {This section only applies if you chose to use your TV card's internal tuner.  In this case the next step to get started is to run a provider scan from the Configure menu.  During the scan all TV channels are checked for Nextview transmissions and a list of Nextview providers is built from the result.
} {} {You can speed up the scan by using a TV application's channel table; in this case the scan is limited to TV frequencies defined in the TV app's channel table. This mode is enabled with the } {} {Use TV app freq. table} underlined { checkbutton.  This button will be disabled until you've selected a TV application in the } {} {TV app. interaction} underlined { dialog described in the next chapter.  You can open this dialog by pressing the button at the bottom of the EPG scan dialog window.
} {} {At the end of the scan there's a short summary which tells you how many providers have been found.  If there were any, you can close the dialog window and open the provider selection dialog from the Configure menu and select you favorite one.  Then wait a little while the provider's TV channel is tuned and data being loaded.
} {} {If the provider scan does not find any or not all Nextview provider channels (possibly due to weak reception - this is a very simple scan that does not attempt any fine-tuning) enable the } {} {Slow} underlined { button and try again. If this does not help, you can still add the missing providers manually. set the acquisition mode to } {} {external} underlined { or } {} {passive} underlined { (UNIX only). Then use an external application to tune the channel (Windows users have to stop acquisition first; then start the TV application; then tune the channel; then quit the other application; finally start acquisition again).
} {} {In external mode nxtvepg will not touch the tuner and wait infinitly for Nextview reception on the current channel.  On Windows (and Linux with bttv drivers version 0.7.50 and earlier) this method has the disadvantage that no channel number or frequency will be known for this provider so you have to tune the provider's channel manually whenever you start acquisition.
} {} {Acquisition of a complete database takes about 20 minutes. However programmes that are nearer in the future are available much faster, since they are transmitted more often. The currently running and directly following programmes of all networks are usually available after about 2-3 minutes max.
} {} {Configuring a TV application} title2 {
} {} {nxtvepg can cooperate in the following ways with TV applications:
} {} {Loading the TV application's channel table: use of the TV tuner frequencies can significantly speed up the EPG scan (already mentioned above); the channel names are used by the  } indent {Network name} {underlined indent} { dialog in the Configure menu (see } indent {Configuration: Network names} {href indent} {) to synchronize network names between nxtvepg and the TV application.
} indent {Interaction between nxtvepg and the TV application, to provide you with convenience features like an on-screen display of the current programme title after channel changes, changing the channel from inside nxtvepg with the } indent {TuneTV} {underlined indent} { button, and background Nextview data acquisition while you're watching TV.
} indent {The first two are passive features, i.e. only nxtvepg needs to be adapted to the respective TV applications.  The third one however requires cooperation of both sides.  For this reason the number of TV applications for which the passive features are supported will always be much larger.  On Windows the interaction features are currently only supported by K!TV.
} {} {On UNIX only } {} {xawtv} underlined { and } {} {xawdecode} underlined { are supported currently. With both all the features listed above are supported.
} {} {On Windows several freeware TV applications are supported for the passive features; you must select which one you're using. If you've loaded TV card settings from a TV app in the } {} {TV card input} underlined { dialog, then the TV app type and path is already configured.  Else, or if you want to use a different app as source for the channel table, open the } {} {TV app. interaction} underlined { dialog (see also } {} {Configuration: TV application interaction} href {).
} {} {Regarding the third, the active feature: You can check if nxtvepg is able to interact with a specific TV application by starting both, and then opening the TV application interaction dialog in  the Configure menu.  The connection status is indicated in the middle of the dialog window.  Usually nxtvepg will already display an error message when it's started while an unsupported TV application is running, complaining "Capturing is already enabled in the TV card" or another driver error message.  Only with cooperating TV apps nxtvepg is able to automatically free the card when the TV app is started (TV viewing is always given priority over EPG data acquisition.)
} {} {Important} bold {: On Windows you must not run nxtvepg with acquisition enabled at the same time as a TV application.  If you ever accidentially do that, immediately terminate both applications.  When two applications access the TV card hardware at the same time, the resulting conflicts can crash your system.
} {} {After setting up the TV app type and path, you should open the } {} {Network name} underlined { configuration dialog to synchronize network names between nxtvepg and the TV app.  Even if interaction is not possible, it may still be a good idea to have the same network names in both applications.  See } {} {Configuration: Network names} href { for details.

set {helpIndex(Basic browsing)} 3
set helpTexts(3) {{Basic browsing} title1 {
} {} {The browser mainly consists of two windows: the upper one contains a list of programme titles, sorted by start time. All currently running programmes (or rather: all programmes that should be running according to their start time) are marked by a light blue background color. One line in the list is selected by a cursor; the lower window contains the attributes and description for this selected title. The amount of information available here depends entirely on the content provider.
} {} {The basic browsing of programme information works very straight-forward. You can either use the mouse or the keyboard cursor keys:
} {} {With the mouse, you can click on any title to select it and display its description in the lower window. With a double-click you open a popup window with a summary of all attributes known for that title.  See } {} {Filtering} href { on how to use those for filtering. Use the scrollbar to scroll the listing forward to programmes farer in the future.
} {} {With the keyboard, use the Cursor up/down keys to select any title. For fast scrolling use the page up/down keys. With the Home key you always get back to the first title. With TAB and SHIFT-TAB you can move the keyboard input focus to other widgets, e.g. to the network and shortcut lists; to apply a selected theme or shortcut as filter press the Space or Return key. The first 10 shortcuts can also be enabled directly from the main window with the digit keys 1-9 and 0. Control-C in the main window opens the context menu; Control-F opens the text search dialog; the Escape key is equivalent to the Reset button.  The menus can be accessed by pressing the ALT key together with the underlined character in the respective menu button.
} {} {Since version 2.5.0 nxtvepg offers two different layouts for the TV schedules: By default programmes of all channels are combined in a single list sorted by start time, i.e. one big table.  Alternatively programmes can be separated so that each network has it's own column. This format is very similar to most paper-based TV magazines.  In this layout you can scroll both vertically by start-time and horizontally by networks.
} {} {When you resize the main window vertically the difference in height will be added to the info text window at the bottom.  You can adjust the proportions between program listbox and the info text with the "panning" button inbetween, i.e. by dragging the button you can resize the program listbox.
} {} {nxtvepg can interact with TV applications (e.g. } {} {xawtv} underlined { on UNIX; requires initial setup, see } {} {Getting started} href {) to provide a connection in both directions: Firstly you'll find a } {} {Tune-TV} underlined { button in the main window below the clock. When you press it, the network of the currently selected programme will be tuned in the TV application.  With the right mouse button you can also pop up a small menu which offers basic TV controls. Secondly, when you change the channel in the TV application, the cursor in the nxtvepg main window will automatically jump onto the programme currently running on that network. For more details see } {} {Configuration: TV application interaction} href {
} {} {At the bottom of the window there is a status line which informs you about the state of the browser database and background acquisition. It's basically a very dense summary of the } {} {Statistics} bold { popups from the } {} {Control} bold { menu and is especially useful to warn you about the database age or stalled acquisition.
} {} {Note:} underlined { For most providers it holds true that programme content descriptions (i.e. the texts in the lower nxtvepg window) are available only for currently running programmes and those whose start time is very close. This time span for full coverage can be as short as 2 hours, or 3 titles per network. As a consequence you should enable data acquisition as often as possible; consider running the acquisition daemon permanently in the background. For details on the acquisition process see the following chapter.
} {} }
set {helpIndex(Data acquisition)} 4
set helpTexts(4) {{Data acquisition} title1 {
} {} {As long as acquisition is enabled, programme titles are constantly being acquired or updated in the background. You will notice that all incoming programme information is instantly inserted to the programme listing. Every effort is taken to not alter the cursor position or title selection, except if the cursor is on the very first item - then the cursor stays on top.
} {} {By default, the acquisition always works for the provider whose database you have loaded into the browser. Therefore, upon program start or whenever you switch providers, the TV tuner is set onto the frequency of the provider's TV channel.  Please note that this mode is only possible after a provider scan, because that's the only way to find out the frequencies. Check out } {} {Acquisition modes} href { for more sophisticated acquisition strategies.
} {} {If you do not choose the TV tuner as input (e.g. if you choose an external source via the Composite or S-Video input sockets), or if the TV tuner is kept busy by another application (UNIX only, e.g. if you watch TV) data is still being acquired, but it's no longer possible to automatically change the TV channel. Hence you are resposible for selecting the channel of the provider who's database you want to load or refresh.

} {} {The transmitted database is constantly in change: Elapsed titles are removed, new titles appended, and the titles closest to the current time updated with an increased amount of description.

It's mainly intended for users who use more than one provider's database, i.e. in a merged database, or want to optimize startup time.

} indent {Please note: when nxtvepg does not control the input channel, it can not automatically take care of updating your databases. Even if the browser database should be completely empty, no data will appear until you tune in the provider's channel manually with an external application.

} indent {External} bold {
} {} {This is the recommended mode for Composite or S-Video input sources. Only the input source will be set; the tuner is not touched.

} indent {On Windows systems this mode can be used if your tuner is not known to nxtvepg, i.e. if the EPG scan does not find any channels with all of the available tuner types. In this case tune in the provider channel with a TV application; then quit this application and start nxtvepg. When you view the acquisition statistics from the Control menu, the VPS/PDC code of the tuned channel should appear in the lower half of the window.

} {} {The Cyclic modes enables you to optimize startup time. While in standard manual mode, the first database is loaded completely before the next one is started, in Cyclic modes you can specify to load only Now data of all providers first. Hence already after a couple minutes you'll have updated Now information for all providers. If you require more look-ahead than the next 2-3 programmes, e.g. the complete evening, use a Cyclic mode that starts with the Near stage.

} {} {Please note that the time until all databases are complete is longer in the cyclic modes than in standard manual mode. In general, the time used for the Now and Next stages just adds to the time to complete the database.
} {} {Also note that the cyclic modes depend on the transmission cycles of the providers. Firstly this means that the time ranges covered by the cycle stages may differ between providers. Secondly, the cycle times may vary. In the worst case the Near cycle runs as long as the cycle for the complete database (e.g. the German provider RTL2). In this case you don't win anything by selecting a mode that contains a Near stage.

The third one are the database statistics popup windows which offer technical details about the database, e.g. which percentage of entries is already loaded etc., both in textual form and as charts.

As soon as you start acquisition the fill percentage will drop to 0 because a new inventory will have been loaded which no longer contains the expired blocks.
} {} {When acquisition for the browser database stopped more than 60 minutes ago, a note is added to the status line. In this case it may be advisable to start acquisition for this database to load descriptions for programmes that are now included in the "Near" time range (see } {} {Data acquisition} href {).

} indent {When series and theme or likewise series and text searches are combined, programmes which match either of both filter types are listed.  This is an exception from the general rule of combining different filters with a logical AND.

} {} {The invert menu also allows to individually negate certain filter types (there are also invert buttons in some filter sub-menus which have the same function).

} {} {Example 1:} bold { If you want all programmes which are neither categorized as sports nor as children's programmes, select theme filters sport and children's and then invert the current theme filter (usually class #1; you can equivalently use the global invert if themes are the only filter).
} {} {For the theme and sorting criterion filters it's possible to invert only parts of the selection, so that you can require that a programme has a certain attribute and at the same time require that it doesn't have another attribute.
} {} {Example 2:} bold { If you want all programmes which are movies but NOT adult movies, select theme category Movie, switch the theme class to 2, select theme adult and then invert theme class 2.

Hence when you have two themes shortcuts, e.g. "Movies" and "Sports", and select first Movies, then Sports, you'll see only sports programmes afterwards.  However if you had selected theme movies manually, e.g. by the context menu explained in the next chapter, the movies filter might remain set, so that you'd get all programmes of theme movies OR sports.  Since that is usually not what one expects, a filter mask has been introduced to the shortcut setting.
} {} {The filter mask is defined in the shortcuts dialog with a checkbutton for each filter category. By default, the mask is enabled for every filter category you've included in the shortcut filter setting.  When you invoke the shortcut from the main window later, all filters of the given categories will be cleared (masked out) before the shortcut filters are added. To return to the above example: if the "Sports" shortcut is defined with a themes mask, the manually set movies filter would be cleared before the theme filter is set to sports.
} {} {The masking can also be enabled when no filter of that category has been chosen. This can be used to define } {} {undo} underlined { shortcuts. E.g. choose the mask 'Themes' if you want a shortcut that allows to clear all theme-related filters at once.

By using composite attributes you can customize the TV schedule according to your personal preferences.  For example you could (1) alter the display format (e.g. use colors), (2) add text or images as markers for favorite programmes and/or (3) compact display by combining several attributes into one.
} {} {Composite attributes are created and edited via the } {} {Attribute composition} underlined { dialog in the } {} {Configure} underlined { menu (see } {} {Configuration: Attribute composition} href {)

} {} {Whenever nxtvepg displays a programme in the browser, it matches for each column/row (depending on your list layout) which contains compound attributes the programme's attributes against the shortctus associated which the respective compound attribute, in the given order (top to bottom in the dialog's list).  If a match is found, the text, image or attribute which was assigned to that specific shortcut match is displayed in the column.

} {} {Example: to create a personalized version of the } {} {Editorial rating} underlined { (ER) column, you could create three shortcuts: one with the ER filter set to ">=6", one with ">=4" and one with ">=2"; then you'd create a new user-defined column and insert the three shortcuts in this order; to the first shortcut match you'd assign the text "great", to the second "ok" and to the third "bad".  As a result you'd have a column where the numerical ratings are replaced with your texts.

} {} {The catch-all is particularily useful to overlay standard columns with alternate  texts for selected programmes. To stay with the ER example, you could define a column with two shortcut entries: ">=6" and "*no-match*".  To the ">=6" shortcut match you could assign an image marker; to all other the "ER" attribute.  Hence programmes with an ER >=6 (i.e. all "great" programmes) would have an image displayed and hence clearly stand out from all other programmes, which get the regular content of the ER column (i.e. the numerical rating or an empty column for unrated programmes).
} {} {You can also use this machanism to combine several columns into one, to keep the listing compact.  For example you can combine the ER column with the theme column, so that for movies with ER >= 6 the text "great movie" is displayed, for all others the regular theme description.

If your client only supports IPv4, you can force your server to create an IPv4 socket by binding to an IPv4 address.  If you fail to connect to a local IPv6 server via the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, use the IPv6 equivalent "::1".

On UNIX this menu entry is available only when a } {} {.xawtv} underlined { configuration file is found in your home. On Windows you should at least configure your TV application type and path here if you're using one of the supported applications; this is a recommended step during the initial installation to speed up the EPG provider search, as described in } {} {Getting started} href {.
} {} {The first four (only three on UNIX) options allow to  switch interaction features on or off. If you want to improve startup time on UNIX, turn them all off; in this case nxtvepg does not need to search for the } {} {xawtv} underlined { toplevel window (which can take up to several seconds if you have many applications running or a slow connection to your X server.) By default all interaction features are enabled.
} {} {General enable} underlined {
} {} {Windows only: the option allows to disable or re-enable the allocation of communication resources, and implicitly to switch off or on all interaction features. While disabled, nxtvepg will be invisible for the TV application.  The use of this option is depreciated, as nxtvepg won't automatically free the driver when the TV application is started, and nxtvepg will fail to start acquisition when a TV appliaction is running.  Use this option only if you suspect compatibility problems between the TV app and nxtvepg, e.g.  if one application hangs or crashes during startup if the other is already running (I'm not saying such behavior is to be expected, but it's better to be prepared for everything)
} indent {Tune TV button} underlined {
} {} {This option allos to hide or show the equally named button and it's little popup menu (accessed with right mouse button) below the clock in the nxtvepg main window.  If you're not interested in remote-controlling the TV application, switch it off.
} indent {Cursor follows channel changes} underlined {
} {} {While this option is enabled, nxtvepg will monitor TV channel changes. Whenever such a change is detected, the cursor in the programme listbox will be set onto the title currently running on that network. During EPG acquisition VPS/PDC is used to exactly determine the current programme (only on networks which support VPS/PDC); however if the nominal running time is in the past it's currently not possible to display the programme in the listbox. This info may however be sent to the TV app (see next option). If you have just a network filter enabled, it will be switched to the new network so that you'll get a complete listing of that network's programmes, starting with the currently running one. This works even when you have excluded this network in the network selection configuration. If there are more or other filters than network enabled, then they will remain unchanged. If the current programme on the new network does not match this filter setting, then neither cursor nor listbox content will be changed.
} indent {Display EPG info in TV app} underlined {
} {} {While this option is enabled, nxtvepg will monitor TV channel changes. During EPG acquisition VPS/PDC are also monitored to determine newly starting programmes. VPS/PDC also allows to detect channel changes on an external input source, e.g. a satellite receiver connected via the Composite socket. After a change of channel or current programme title, the info about the currently running title will be displayed in the TV application. On Windows it's entirely up to the TV application how this information is displayed.
} indent {On UNIX the display format can be selected by the following radio buttons:
} indent {With } indent {Separate popup} {underlined indent} { nxtvepg will generate a small popup window and put it right beneath the xawtv window. The blue area in the small bar on top represents how much of the (nominal) running time lies in the past. With } indent {Video overlay} {underlined indent} { nxtvepg will generate a similar popup, however it's placed on top of the video image (please note that this option only works properly with XFree86 version 4 and the XVideo extension; use the } indent {xvinfo} {bold indent} { command to check if your server supports this feature).  You can change fonts and colors in this popup via X resources (see } indent {Files} {href indent} { for details.) } indent {Video overlay, 2 lines} {underlined indent} { is the same except that it writes running time and title in separate lines and additionally contains the percentage of expired running time. With } indent {Xawtv window title} {underlined indent} { the info will be sent to xawtv and displayed in the window title. Except for this last option, you can configure the desired display duration with the slider at the bottom of the dialog. A duration of zero means the display will never be removed.
} indent {Windows only: in the middle of the dialog there's one line that indicates the current TV application connection status.  It contains the name of the connected application or } {} {not connected} underlined {. You can connect to different applications than configured below, but if the network names are not synchronized with nxtvepg, the interaction will not work optimally (i.e. nxtvepg might not be able to identify all networks, and hence not be able to provide programme titles).
} {} {Windows only: in the lower part of the dialog window you can configure the type and path of your preferred TV application.  This information is used to access the TV app's channel table (i.e. TV tuner frequencies and station names) during an EPG provider scan (see } {} {Configuration: Provider scan} href {) and in the network name configuration dialog (see } {} {Configuration: Network names} href {). After you've changed the setting, you can press the } {} {Test} underlined { button to check if nxtvepg can parse the channel table correctly. It will complain if it fails to open the file or registry key and if no channels are found. After the test was successful, you shoud open the network names configuration dialog and synchronize network names with nxtvepg.
} {} {If your TV application is not supported, choose } {} {none} underlined {.  (If it's a freeware application feel free to mail me a download URL and I will consider supporting it.  However I will not support proprietary closed-source software, unless on request by the author.)
} {} {Note that not all of the TV applications listed in the popup menu can currently interact with nxtvepg.  The interaction requires modifications in the TV applications; it's up to the respective authors if they want to implement these.

} {} {Select attributes} title2 {
} {} {Open the programme attribute display configuration dialog, which allows to select which attributes are displayed for the listed TV programmes. In the listbox on the left of the dialog window there's a list of all available attribute categories, e.g. title, running time, weekday, TV network name, ratings, ... i.e. mostly the same which are available for filtering.  You can create your own attributes to extend this list with the dialog described in the next chapter.
} {} {The listbox on the right contains the types currently selected for display.  The topmost entry appears on the left side of the listbox. Press } {} {Apply} underlined { to refresh the browser listbox with the new column selection and save the new configuration to the config file.
} {} {In the "single list" layout (see } {} {Configuration: List layout} href {) each attribute has it's own column in the TV schedule and and associated filter menu in the button on top of the column (provided column headers have not been disabled, see } {} {Configuration: Show/Hide} href {.)  You can change the width of each column by moving the mouse pointer to the very right of the menu button and then dragging the border to a new position while keeping the left mouse button pressed down.
} {} {In the "spearate network columns" layout attributes are printed beneath each other in separate lines in the TV schedule's network columns, unless you select } {} {No new line after element} underlined { while the respective attribute is selected in the right listbox. Empty rows are automatically suppressed, e.g. in contrary to the "single list" layout the number of attributes actually displayed may vary.  This is particularily useful for user-defined attributes, e.g. you could specify that theme categories are only printed for movies to keep the listing more compact.
} {} {Attribute composition} title2 {
} {} {Open the configuration dialog for } {} {composite attributes} underlined {, which allows to create new column types for the "single list" TV schedule layout (see } {} {Configuration: List layout} href {) or new rows respectively in the "spearate network columns" layout, which can afterwards be selected in addition to the predefined attribute types (e.g. "Title" and "Theme") as described in the previous chapter.
} {} {For a general description of composite attributes see } {} {Composite attributes} href {.  This chapter only describes usage of the configuration dialog.
} {} {The dialog consists of three sections: at the top to the right there is a drop-down menu which lists all user-defined attributes. Here you select which attribute definition you want to edit.  Below to the left is the list of shortcuts and 4 buttons to edit the list.  On the right side of the shortcut list there are various controls for defining how a shortcut match should be displayed.
} {} {Note that there are dependencies between those sections: when you change to a different attribute definition with the drop-down menu at the top, the rest of the dialog is immediately updated to display the current definition of the composite attribute (you'll get a warning if there any unsaved changes in the previous assignments).  Also, when you select a shortcut in the listbox, the display attributes at the right are updated.
} {} {To create a new composite attribute, you will start by selecting the } {} {Create new definition} underlined { command in the menu at the top right of the dialog window. You should give the label right away, so that you can keep your definitions apart in the } {} {Attribute selection} underlined { configuration dialog. You should also assign a column header text (only used in the "single list" layout), which will appear in the TV schedule browser; you'll probably use a shorter text here than in the label.
} {} {Then you add one or more shortcuts to the list by use of the } {} {add} underlined { drop-down menu to the left of the listbox. You can change the order of the shortcuts by use of the arrow buttons, or delete them again with the } {} {delete} underlined { button.
} {} {By default a shortcut match is displayed as the name of the shortcut. You can change that with the controls to the right of the listbox. The choices are: freely defined text, one of the pre-defined images or one of the programme's attributes (i.e. if you select } {} {Time} underlined { the programme's start time will be displayed).  For textual output you can additionally select a format below: either bold, underlined or colored. All these display options can be configured separately for every shortcut match.
} {} {When you want to try out your attribute definition, press the } {} {Apply} underlined { button at the bottom.  The definition is saved and the browser content is updated.  If the attribute is not currently used in the browser, you're offered in a popup message to automatically append the attribute to the TV schedule.  You can later change it's position by using the } {} {Attribute selection} underlined { configuration dialog.
} {} {There's also a } {} {Delete} underlined { button at the bottom which allows to remove obsolete definitions.  If the composite attribute is still displayed in the browser, it's automatically removed.  Note that a deletion cannot be undone, i.e. the information is lost irrecoverably.
} {} {Select networks} title2 {
} {} {Open the network selection dialog. It allows to permanently suppress TV networks in a provider's listing, e.g. if you can not receive the channel. You can also change the order of the networks, e.g. to put your favorite networks at the top of the filter menus.
} {} {This window has two lists: on the left you'll find all networks that are covered by the provider in their original order, on the right those that are selected for the programme listing in your preferred order. By default, both lists will have exactly the same content. If you want to exclude networks, select them in the right list and press } {} {Delete} underlined {. You can always include them again by selecting them in the left list and pressing } {} {Add} underlined {. You can change the order in the right list by selecting one or more networks and pressing the } {} {up} underlined { or } {} {down} underlined { arrows.
} {} {If you want the same selection and order for all providers, you can simply copy your order and selection with the } {} {copy} underlined { popup menu;  this menu contains a list of all known providers.  Note that if you copy from a provider with less (or different) networks, those networks that are missing in the other provider's database appear at the end of the network selection in the right listbox.
} {} {At the bottom of the dialog window there's an entry field named } {} {Air times} bold { that allows to limit the program listing for a network to a given time frame. For example if you receive } {} {Arte} underlined { only from 19:00 until 07:00 o'clock, select "Arte" either in the left or right list, then enter "19:00" and "07:00" in the fields (make sure to always use 4 digits and the separating colon).  Programmes that fall completely outside that window will not appear in the browser window.  If you want to undo the limitation, enter 00:00 until 00:00 or any other equal time values.
} {} {Note: you can also operate this dialog (and all other dialogs with similar listbox selections) with he keyboard: use the TAB key or the mouse to move the keyboard input focus to the left or right listbox. Use the cursor up/down keys to select an item; hold down SHIFT to select multiple items. In the left list, press Return to add a network to the right list. In the right list, press the Delete key to remove a network, or press CONTROL and the up/down cursor keys to change the selected items' position in the list.
} {} {Network names} title2 {
} {} {Open the network names configuration dialog. It's main purpose is to synchronize the network names between nxtvepg and your TV application. This is required because the network name is used in communication when you use the } {} {Tune TV} underlined { remote controls, and as well for channel change notifications by the TV applications.  For many networks there will be no need to change anything, but for some there exist different variants, e.g. in Germany "Super RTL" vs. "S-RTL" or "MDR3" vs. "MDR".
} {} {If you're not using UNIX, you first need to select which TV application you want to synchronize with and where the configuration files are located.  This is done in the } {} {TV app. interaction} underlined { dialog in the Configure menu (see } {} {Configuration: TV application interaction} href {).
} {} {Another use of this dialog is to make network naming consistent across all Nextview providers. The names you specify here will be used in the programme listbox and all filter menus, independently of the provider.
} {} {On the left side of the dialog you find a list of all networks of all known Nextview providers. The names used here are the ones you configured before, or if you haven't done so yet, the names that match the station names of your TV application best. Unmatched names are marked red.  If no TV application is configured, each network's name is taken from the first Nextview database which covers this network, in order of your provider selection history.
} {} {On the right side, you're offered four ways to change the name: topmost is a simple entry field where you can type in an arbitrary name. Below is a popup menu which contains all network names defined in your TV app.'s channel table.  Below is a button which contains the one name in your TV app.'s channel table which resembles the current string in the entry field most, or } {} {none} underlined {. It's marked red until it's identical to the entry field. You can copy the name to the entry field by clicking the button. Below is a listbox with the original names used in the various provider databases. When you select a name from the menu or the listbox, it will be copied into the entry field and the network name list on the left. If you want to save the changed list, leave the dialog with } {} {Save} underlined {, else use } {} {Abort} underlined {.
} {} {Note: if you receive channels that carry multiple networks, e.g. in Germany "Arte / Kinderkanal", it's recommended to include all networks' names in the network name on side of the TV application, separated by a slash.  The slash is recognized as separator by nxtvepg and all resulting segments can be used as network names.
} {} {Context menu extensions} title2 {
} {} {Open the context menu configuration dialog which allows to extend the popup menu with user-defined external commands (for a general description of the context menu see } {} {Context menu} href {).
} {} {At the top of the dialog window there is a list of all currently defined command titles. When you open the dialog for the first time, it'll be empty.
} {} {Below the list there are two text input fields which allow to modify or create new commands. The field labeled } {} {Title} bold { defines the text which will be included to the popup menu.  The field labeled } {} {Command} bold { defines the command line to be executed when the entry is selected in the popup menu, with possible placeholders enclosed in ${} which are replaced by parameters of the currently selected programme in the browser listbox. After the substitution and after appending an ampersand '&' sign to allow asynchronous execution (UNIX only), the command line is passed to a shell via the system(3) function.
} {} {When you press the menu button } {} {Copy Example} underlined { a list pops up which contains a few example commands which can be copied into the title and command entry fields.  To save a new or modified title and command, you have to press either the } {} {New} underlined { or } {} {Update} underlined { button and leave the popup with } {} {Ok} underlined {.

The file could be used to change the "look" of almost every element in every dialog window (within limits, because some options are hard-coded) or the look of entire widget classes, like menus or buttons. However that's highly implementation dependent and generally not very useful, hence depreciated.
} indent {Defaults for all officially supported options are listed in the app-defauls file } indent {Nxtvepg.ad} {underlined indent} { which is usually installed in } indent {/usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults} {underlined indent} { (without the .ad extension).  You should not change valus there however, because they would be overwritten when you install new versions.  Instead copy changed lines into your .Xdefaults file (without the leading comment ! sign.) When X11 is already started you can override settings with xrdb like this:
} indent {   echo "nxtvepg*text_bg: #E9E9EC" | xrdb -merge

} {pfixed indent} {Color values can specified either symbolically (e.g. "red") or as hexadecimal RGB values in #RRGGBB format. Fonts must be specified as triplets of family, size (use negative values to specify the size in pixels and positive values for sizes given in points) and appearance (only "normal" or "bold" are recommended).  Lines starting with a ! sign are treated as comment and hence ignored.  Entries that do not adhere to this syntax are silently discarded.
} indent {Files used on Windows systems} title2 {
} {} {nxtvepg.ini} bold {
} {} {Configuration file where all configuration and personal preference settings are stored. By default this is created in the working directory, but a different path and file name can be specified with the } indent {-rcfile} {bold indent} { option (see } indent {Options} {href indent} {).
} indent {nxtvepg.ad} bold {
} {} {Allows to change the application's appearance, i.e. colors and text fonts. The format and content of the file is identical to the } indent {.Xdefaults} {underlined indent} { file described in the UNIX section.
} indent {nxtv____.epg} bold {
} {} {One file for each provider's database is created in the working directory or the one given with the } indent {-dbdir} {bold indent} { command line option (see } indent {Options} {href indent} {). The last 4 digits of the file base names are the hexadecimal CNI (Country and Network Identifier) of the provider.  You must not change the name of this file, or nxtvepg will refuse to load the database.
} indent {vbi_map.dat} bold {
} {} {This hidden file is used to set up shared memory to allow information exchange between nxtvepg and an attached TV application.  It's automatically removed when nxtvepg terminates and should never be accessed (i.e. being written to or removed) by external applications. The file is not created when TV app. interaction is disabled (see } indent {Configuration: TV application interaction} {href indent} {).
} indent }
