Hi there,

in this software package you find a decoder for Nextview - an Electronic
Programme Guide for the analog domain (as opposed to the various digital EPGs
that come with most digital broadcasts). It allows you to receive and browse
TV programme listings for most of the major networks in Germany, France and
Switzerland.

Currently Nextview EPG is transmitted by:
- in Germany and Austria: Pro7, 3Sat, RTL-II, EuroNews.
- in Switzerland: TSR1 and others.
- in France: Canal+, M6, TV5.

If you don't receive any of those, then this software is useless to you.

To compile and use this software, you need:
- Pentium class PC with a Bt848 or Bt878 based TV tuner card
- Linux with kernel >= 2.0.35 and bttv driver (video4linux)
- GNU C Compiler
- Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or later (ftp://www.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/)

As of now, there's no supprt for M$ Windows. Please read the file `Windows'.

Installation procedure:
- Recommended: first install a TV application like xtvscreen or xawtv, or
  preferrably a teletext decoder to be sure the video/vbi driver works fine.
- You MUST check the paths in the Makefile, esp. for Tcl/Tk
- make
  if compilation fails, check the type definitions in epgctl/mytypes.h first.
  Required types are: schar, uchar, sint, uint, slong, ulong.
- make install

If the GUI shows up but does not react to any input, you probably
need to tell Tcl/Tk where to find it's libraries. To do so, correct
the paths in TCL_LIBRARY_PATH and TK_LIBRARY_PATH in the Makefile.

If you need to change anything besides the Makefile, please let me
know about it (i.e. send me the diffs)

Before you email me, please check the manual page as well as the TODO
and CHANGES files. The latest version of this software is available at:

have fun.
