Nextview EPG Decoder/Analyzer for PC
------------------------------------

This software package contains a free decoder for Nextview EPG,
an Electronic Programme Guide, that's transmitted by a number
of European Channels in the analog domain. Usually not only
the program of the provider's channel itself is covered, but
most of the country's relevant channels.

Currently Nextview EPG is transmitted by:
- in Germany and Austria: Pro7, 3Sat, RTL-II, EuroNews.
- in Switzerland: TSR1 and others.
- in France: Canal+, M6, TV5.

If you don't receive any of those channels then this software
is useless to you.

To compile and use this software, you need:
- one Pentium class PC with a Bt8x8-based TV tuner card
- Linux with bttv driver (video4linux)
- gcc
- xtvscreen or other TV application to tune in the provider's channel
- Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or later (ftp://www.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/)


If the GUI shows up but does not react to any input, you probably
need to tell Tcl/Tk where to find it's libraries. To do so, correct
the paths in TCL_LIBRARY_PATH and TK_LIBRARY_PATH in the Makefile.


For specific information about the Nextview standard and
it's transportation inside teletext, please refer to ETSI
specifications ETS 300 707, 708 and 706 available at
http://www.etsi.org/


More documentation will follow in the future.

have fun.
