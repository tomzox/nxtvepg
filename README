Hi there,

in this software package you find a decoder for Nextview - an Electronic
TV Programme Guide for the analog domain (as opposed to the various digital
EPGs that come with most digital broadcasts). It allows you to decode and
browse TV programme listings for most of the major networks in Germany,
Austria, France and Switzerland.

Currently Nextview EPG is transmitted by:
- in Germany and Austria: Pro7, 3Sat, RTL-II.
- in Switzerland: TSR1, EuroNews and others.
- in France: Canal+, M6, TV5.

If you don't receive any of those, then this software is useless to you
(except for a demo mode, see the documentation.)

The Nextview standard was developed by the major European consumer electronics
manufacturers under the hood of the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (http://www.etsi.org/) in 1995-1997. The author of this software
has no connections whatsoever to the ETSI - but he still hopes it's kindly
tolerated.


System requirements:

Hardware requirements are a Pentium class PC and a Bt848 or Bt878 based
TV tuner card.

Linux software requirements:
- kernel >= 2.0.35 (upgrade to 2.2.x highly recommended for bttv users!)
- bttv driver (video4linux), version >= 0.7.35 recommended
- GNU C Compiler
- Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or later (8.3 recommended)
  available from http://www.scriptics.com/

Windows software requirements:
- Windows NT or Windows 95. Other variants may work too but are yet untested.
- On Windows NT: you need to be in the Admininstrator group.
- WinDriver version 4.0 or later, available from http://www.krftech.com/
  This is *not* freeware, however there's a free 30 days evaluation version.
  Note: there are patched versions of this driver which do not show the demo
  message, e.g. at http://freetv.norix.de/ in the MultiDec package, but those
  are probably not legal.

If you want to compile for Windows you also need:
- CygWin GNU make and compiler, see http://www.cygwin.org/
- Microsoft Visual C Compiler (Borland C probably works too)
- Tcl/Tk 8.3.2, available from http://www.scriptics.com/
- windrvr.h and windrvr_usb.h from the WinDriver package


UNIX installation procedure:

- Recommended: first install a TV application like xtvscreen or xawtv, or
  preferrably a teletext decoder to be sure the video/vbi drivers work fine.
- You MUST check the paths in the Makefile, esp. for Tcl/Tk
- make
  if compilation fails, check the type definitions in epgctl/mytypes.h first.
  Required types are: schar, uchar, sint, uint, slong, ulong.
- If you compile on a non-supported operating system or if you don't have
  bttv, then compile epgvbi/btdrv4dummy instead of btdrv4linux; acquisition
  will of course not be possible.
- make install
- Invoke the application and start a provider scan from the Configure menu.
  Further details can be found in the man page.

If the GUI shows up but does not react to any input, you probably
need to tell Tcl/Tk where to find it's libraries. To do so, correct
the paths in TCL_LIBRARY_PATH and TK_LIBRARY_PATH in the Makefile.
If you need to change anything besides the Makefile, please let me
know about it (i.e. send me the diffs)


Windows installation procedure:

- Unpack the zip file into a new directory.
- Obtain the WinDriver (see above) and copy the .sys and .vxd files
  into the same directory. If you installed the original WinDriver
  package they can be found in WINNT/system32/drivers.
- Invoke the executable nxtvepg.exe and follow the instructions in
  "Getting Started" from the Help menu.



Bug reports:

Before you email me any bug reports, please check the manual page as well
as the TODO and CHANGES files. Please recompile with the -g option in
CFLAGS and enable all debug options in mytypes.h by assigning ON instead
of OFF. Then try to reproduce your problem and send me resulting debug.out
log file.

The latest version of this software is available at:

have fun.
