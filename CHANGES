If you need a detailed overview of differences between versions, ask for the
RCS log files. In this file you'll find only a very brief listing of major
changes or additions.

Before you submit any feature requests, please read the TODO file.

from 0.4.5 to 0.5.0 (Apr. 2001)
- main window is now vertically resizable. The proportions of program listbox
  and info text can be adjusted with a "panning" button (slider)
- added "Tune TV" button in the main window to remote control xawtv (UNIX only)
- added network name configuration dialog to sync names with .xawtv
  and to allow consistant network naming across all providers
- use channel assignments in .xawtv rc file to speed up EPG scan (UNIX only)
- added "Update filter shortcut" dialog to the filter menu to simplify changing
  existing shortcuts
- made handling of filter shortcut dialog fool-proof
- added filter settings description to the shortcut configuration dialog.
  Removed the filter combination checkboxes (were disabled anyway)
- added acquisition mode "external" for Composite/S-Video input source (or
  unknown win32 tuner types)  Win32: suppressed obsolete acq mode "passive".
- fixed command line option -rcfile for Win32: backslash chars in path vanished
- restructured software to simplify reuse as library in other projects

from 0.4.4 to 0.4.5 (Mar. 2001)
- fixed bug in NetBSD daylight saving time handling, due to which programmes
  were shifted by 60 minutes. Thanks to Mario Kemper for the patch.
- fixed bug in Tcl proc LoadRc, due to which rc reload failed.
  Thanks to Dan Lindstroem for the patch (Dan.Lindstroem@t-online.de)

from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4 (Feb. 2001)
- please note my new email address: tomzo at nefkom.net
- fixed severe bug in database reload (reference to freed block;
  curiously this led to crashes under Windows only)
- fixed compatibility with old bttv driver versions (versions <= 0.6.x produced
  error "VIDIOCSCHAN: operation not supported" during TV channel changes)
- added detection of lost VBI frames (Linux, for debugging/optimization only)
- added frequency table for France; minor fixes in Western Europe table;
  tables can be selected via the TV card input popup
- updated tuner type table for Windows Bt8x8 driver -> support for new tuners
- implemented hyperlinks in help pages for references between chapters

from 0.4.pre2 to 0.4.3 (Feb. 2001)
- fixed various glitches in acquisition mode handling and warnings
- added warning when acq mode is forced passive due to non-tuner input source
- finally added chapter about merged databases to documentation
- split off EPG scan sources from epgacqctl.c into separate module epgscan.c
- temp workaround for merged db statistics: supress unsupported categories
- improved presentation of merged descriptions: suppress redundant text
- added transmission error handling: do not replace equivalent block with a
  copy with more parity errors (in the string segment)
- introduced EPG scan options "Slow" and "Refresh" for bad reception or
  database loss, respectively
- added OI header and message to provider selection popup
- network selection popup: added possibility to copy CNI order and suppression
  between providers
- added infos to README about Windows driver installation; thanks to Mario.
- browser listbox format now configurable: now columns can be freely selected
  from 16 attribute types, including title, time, date, theme, ratings, etc.
- added browser listbox column header buttons with drop-down menus
- fixed substring search with latin-1 chars: did not work due to new internal
  encoding in Tcl 8.3 (UTF8)
- fixed dynamic menus on Win32 (e.g. context menu, series menu, Navigate):
  Windows does not generate unmap event, hence the menu content always
  remained the same, regardless of PI selection or even provider changes
- fixed program crash on Win32 while error MessageBox was displayed via Tcl:
  crashed when the mouse was moved from the desktop directly into the main win

from 0.4.pre1 to 0.4.pre2 (Jan. 2001)
- Added status line below browser window for db coverage and acq status
- Statistics windows now available separately for browser and acq databases.
  Added pie chart in addition to history diagram.
- Acquisition statistics are now updated even while no EPG reception, to
  allow analysis of reception trouble. Added output of VPS/PDC CNI.
- NetBSD: patch from Mario to fix possible hangup of VBI slave after an
  external /dev/video application is terminated.
- Windows Bt8x8 driver: added PLL init for 35MHz; Improved driver start on NT;
  Fixed blue screen during shutdown and crashes: exceptions and the shutdown
  message are now catched and the driver stopped before the program exits;
  Disabled registry hack for legal reasons.

from 0.4.pre0 to 0.4.pre1 (Jan. 2001)
- presentation of descriptions of merged databases improved
  by adding a separator image (horizontal line) between the texts.
- added support for Net/Free/OpenBSD Unix in btdrv4linux by Mario Kemper
- described Windows installation in more depth and length in the README file
- compatibility with Windows driver version 4.00
- updated registry hack for Windows Bt8x8 driver 4.31 and later
- command line can take database path as last argument
  This is intended for Windows, to be able to drag and drop a database file
  onto the executable, but can generally be used to set -dbdir and -provider
- added warning messages for database reload errors or missing frequencies

from 0.3.4 to 0.4.pre0 (Dec. 2000)
- added possibility to merge several provider databases into one
- cyclic acquisition between several databases
- added TV input configuration popup
- added Help button to all popups
  order of Help, Abort, Ok identical in all popups
- port to M$ Windows (in new module epgvbi/btdrv4win.c)

- automatic shortcut deselection when it's filters are manually undone
- timescale windows are reloaded after AI version changed and
  not closed anymore upon provider change
- created manual page & help menu
- added install rule to Makefile and added installations instructions to README
- changed default for db directory to /usr/tmp/nxtvepg; added option -dbdir
- added command line option -card for alternate vbi & video devices
  (needed when there's more than one TV card)
- added context menu, invoked by right mouse button: allows quick filter
  selection, depending on currently selected title
- show copyright & helpful message if no provider known or db empty
- added programme title & feature summary to short-info field

from 0.01a to 0.02a
- added rc/ini file to save filter shortcuts and other config options
- added netwop configuration for general exclusion of non-receptable
  netwops and for personalized network ordering

  statistic on how many blocks on the range given in AI were
  acquired.
