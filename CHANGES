If you need a detailed overview of differences between versions, ask for the
RCS log files. In this file you'll find only a very brief listing of major
changes or additions.

Before you submit any feature requests, please read the TODO file.

from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1 (2001-August-30)
- fixed bug in GUI: when programme listbox column headers were disabled,
  the main window was much too wide (calculated width as pixels, but applied
  as if millimeters).
- fixed bug in block management which allowed for PI blocks to remain in the
  database although the valid network block range was declared void in the AI.
  This could result in fill percentages > 100 in the statistic output.

from 0.5.2 to 0.6.0 (2001-August-25)
- possibility to invoke user-defined external commands from the context
  menu in the browser listbox, e.g. to program a timer for the selected
  programme.
- new dialog in the control menu to dump of the entire programme list or
  selected programme descriptions into a file in HTML format.
- added option Match full to the text search dialog to allow exact
  title matches, e.g. a search for "heute" will no longer match on
  "heute journal" when full match is enabled.
- alphabetically sorted series list in the filter menu.
- internal change only: separated the EPG scan cleanly from the acq control
  state machine.
- added RPM spec which allows to install directly from the source tarball
- bugfix in epgblock.c for Power-PC platform; thanks to Gerd Knorr.

from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2 (2001-June-14)
- bugfix programme listbox: the network filter did not follow xawtv channel
  changes. Thanks to Werner Renhardt (werner at kangaroo.at)
- bugfix cyclic acquisition (bug was introduced in 0.5.1): expired programmes
  were not counted for acquisition statistics, hence sometimes the acq engine
  did not detect when the database was complete and did not move on to the
  next provider.

from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1 (June/5/2001)
- monitor the _XAWTV_STATION property on the xawtv window and VPS/PDC (during
  EPG acquisition) to detect channel changes (new source module epgui/xawtv.c;
  communication with xawtv is now done directly via X11 calls, and no longer
  uses the xawtv-remote utility)
- after a channel change, optionally set the programme listing's cursor on
  the programme currently running on this channel and/or display the programme
  title and running time information inside xawtv, either in a popup, as
  overlay (requires xfree4 and the XVideo extension) or window title message.
- improved handling of the network name configuration dialog by addition of
  a "Closest match in xawtv" button.
- fix: during refresh, the cursor now remains on the same start time and network
- fix: short info text view is no longer set to line 1.0 during every update
- fix: possible crash due to reference to freed memory when acq timescale
  popup was open & bad reception (block discarded due to parity errors)
- fix: in cyclic or follow-ui acquisition modes when acquisition was forced
  passive on a non-provider channel (e.g. by a busy video device) acq control
  did not automatically switch to active when the device was freed.
- fix: network name configuration: name selection from the provider listbox
  was handled incorrectly for networks which were not covered by all providers,
  so that another than the selected name was actually used.
- added support for multi-network channel names (e.g. [Arte / Kinderkanal])
  to network name configuration: split xawtv station names around '/' and
  use all resulting segments for matching with Nextview network names.
- added support for Turkish charset in national option table; 6 characters
  which are not in latin-1 are replaced by their ASCII counterparts.
- fixed two memory leaks in the EPG scan and wrong handling of the EPG MIP
  entry, which slowed down the scan on several channels.
- changed Makefile.win32 to use gcc/mingw32 for compilation. The supplied
  Tcl/Tk libraries are compiled with gcc too (on NT using cygwin)

from 0.4.5 to 0.5.0 (Apr. 2001)
- main window is now vertically resizable. The proportions of program listbox
  and info text can be adjusted with a "panning" button (slider)
- added "Tune TV" button in the main window to remote control xawtv (UNIX only)
- added network name configuration dialog to sync names with .xawtv
  and to allow consistant network naming across all providers
- use channel assignments in .xawtv rc file to speed up EPG scan (UNIX only)
- added "Update filter shortcut" dialog to the filter menu to simplify changing
  existing shortcuts
- made handling of filter shortcut dialog fool-proof
- added filter settings description to the shortcut configuration dialog.
  Removed the filter combination checkboxes (were disabled anyway)
- added acquisition mode "external" for Composite/S-Video input source (or
  unknown win32 tuner types)  Win32: suppressed obsolete acq mode "passive".
- fixed command line option -rcfile for Win32: backslash chars in path vanished
- restructured software to simplify reuse as library in other projects

from 0.4.4 to 0.4.5 (Mar. 2001)
- fixed bug in NetBSD daylight saving time handling, due to which programmes
  were shifted by 60 minutes. Thanks to Mario Kemper for the patch.
- fixed bug in Tcl proc LoadRc, due to which rc reload failed.
  Thanks to Dan Lindstroem for the patch (Dan.Lindstroem@t-online.de)

from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4 (Feb. 2001)
- please note my new email address: tomzo at nefkom.net
- fixed severe bug in database reload (reference to freed block;
  curiously this led to crashes under Windows only)
- fixed compatibility with old bttv driver versions (versions <= 0.6.x produced
  error "VIDIOCSCHAN: operation not supported" during TV channel changes)
- added detection of lost VBI frames (Linux, for debugging/optimization only)
- added frequency table for France; minor fixes in Western Europe table;
  tables can be selected via the TV card input popup
- updated tuner type table for Windows Bt8x8 driver -> support for new tuners
- implemented hyperlinks in help pages for references between chapters

from 0.4.pre2 to 0.4.3 (Feb. 2001)
- fixed various glitches in acquisition mode handling and warnings
- added warning when acq mode is forced passive due to non-tuner input source
- finally added chapter about merged databases to documentation
- split off EPG scan sources from epgacqctl.c into separate module epgscan.c
- temp workaround for merged db statistics: supress unsupported categories
- improved presentation of merged descriptions: suppress redundant text
- added transmission error handling: do not replace equivalent block with a
  copy with more parity errors (in the string segment)
- introduced EPG scan options "Slow" and "Refresh" for bad reception or
  database loss, respectively
- added OI header and message to provider selection popup
- network selection popup: added possibility to copy CNI order and suppression
  between providers
- added infos to README about Windows driver installation; thanks to Mario.
- browser listbox format now configurable: now columns can be freely selected
  from 16 attribute types, including title, time, date, theme, ratings, etc.
- added browser listbox column header buttons with drop-down menus
- fixed substring search with latin-1 chars: did not work due to new internal
  encoding in Tcl 8.3 (UTF8)
- fixed dynamic menus on Win32 (e.g. context menu, series menu, Navigate):
  Windows does not generate unmap event, hence the menu content always
  remained the same, regardless of PI selection or even provider changes
- fixed program crash on Win32 while error MessageBox was displayed via Tcl:
  crashed when the mouse was moved from the desktop directly into the main win

from 0.4.pre1 to 0.4.pre2 (Jan. 2001)
- Added status line below browser window for db coverage and acq status
- Statistics windows now available separately for browser and acq databases.
  Added pie chart in addition to history diagram.
- Acquisition statistics are now updated even while no EPG reception, to
  allow analysis of reception trouble. Added output of VPS/PDC CNI.

  external /dev/video application is terminated.
- Windows Bt8x8 driver: added PLL init for 35MHz; Improved driver start on NT;
  Fixed blue screen during shutdown and crashes: exceptions and the shutdown
  message are now catched and the driver stopped before the program exits;
  Disabled registry hack for legal reasons.

from 0.4.pre0 to 0.4.pre1 (Jan. 2001)
- presentation of descriptions of merged databases improved
  by adding a separator image (horizontal line) between the texts.
- added support for Net/Free/OpenBSD Unix in btdrv4linux by Mario Kemper
- described Windows installation in more depth and length in the README file
- compatibility with Windows driver version 4.00
- updated registry hack for Windows Bt8x8 driver 4.31 and later
- command line can take database path as last argument
  This is intended for Windows, to be able to drag and drop a database file
  onto the executable, but can generally be used to set -dbdir and -provider
- added warning messages for database reload errors or missing frequencies

from 0.3.4 to 0.4.pre0 (Dec. 2000)

  not closed anymore upon provider change
- created manual page & help menu
- added install rule to Makefile and added installations instructions to README
- changed default for db directory to /usr/tmp/nxtvepg; added option -dbdir
- added command line option -card for alternate vbi & video devices
  (needed when there's more than one TV card)
- added context menu, invoked by right mouse button: allows quick filter
  selection, depending on currently selected title
