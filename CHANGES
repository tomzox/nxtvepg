from 0.01a to 0.02a (pre-release)

- added netwop configuration for general exclusion of non-receptable
  netwops and for personalized network ordering
- added command line options (UNIX only)
- added shortcut add&edit popup and implemented "merge" mode
- added EPG scan and "active acquisition mode"; the tuner is set
  to the chanel of the selected ui db, if possible (UNIX only)
- maintain list of "obsolete" PI, i.e. PI that could not be added
  to the db or are expired. This now allows to generate an exact
  statistic on how many blocks on the range given in AI were
