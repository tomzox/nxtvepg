nxtvepg version 0.4.pre0 is just a snapshot of work in progress.
The following features are still incomplete and need to be fixed
before the next release. If you find any bugs not listed here,
please let me know.

db merge fixes:
- fine control for provider merge
- change of CNI list -> keep suppressed list, even if obsolete?
- short/long info merging: remove redundant text, add newline between providers
- version & block index handling (for timescales)

acq mode ctl. & cyclic acq fixes:
- warn when db has no tuner freq
- better handling of db version changes: display message
  take tuner freq from obsolete db version also
- check if version is incompatible before recommending prov selection
- acqmode popup: check for device-access or no-tuner errors
- stats window:
  + report acq mode, cycle phase and index
  + update even if no EPG reception; include CNI

WIN32 port fixes:
- accepting db as argument: set path as working dir, take CNI from filename
- dump stream feature: must window or file instead of stdout
- timezone popup required?
- README and manpage
  + Erklaerung aller Startup Fehlermeldungen
  + Liste von TV-Karten und zugehoerigen Tunertypen (bttv-cards.h)


+++ Already DONE +++
- ui stays empty while acq finds 1st db in the background
- EpgAcqCtl_GetDbState: disable all filters for SearchPi
- different msg for EPGDB_ACQ_WAIT if acq is not follow-ui
- timeout in case of reception failure
- automatic upgrade from follow-ui to cyclic for merged db
- service name for merged db: concatenate prov names
- delay after target variance is reached
- passive & non-TV-tuner input modes
- option -dbdir: need WIN32 error handling in main


required fixes:
- EPG scan skips some channels with bad reception or encryption
- latin-1 chars in substring search do not work with Tcl/Tk 8.3
- do not tune channel if vbi busy
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- improve sync with acq slave process:
  + acq abort: slave should pass errno as reason via shmem
  + sigchld -> acq off
  + check parent every 30 sec, also when no ttx reception
- count parity errors before replacing blocks of same version
- debugging: make serious debugX events fatal (developers only)

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- timer programming & invocation or external dispatch
- long-term search: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time
  new data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching PI arrives. This
  can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches
- multiple VBI devices (locally or in network)
