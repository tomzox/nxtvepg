nxtvepg version 0.4.preX is just a snapshot of work in progress.
The following features are still incomplete and need to be fixed
before the next release. If you find any bugs not listed here,
please let me know.

mail to Linux bttv maintainer:
- CGFREQ on /dev/vbi does not work
- set input source on /dev/vbi not possible
- how to get frame number from vbi buffer?

db merge fixes:
- documentation missing
- fine control for provider merge
- new provider selection -> keep all CNIs from suppressed list, even if obsolete?
- version & block index handling (for timescales)

acq mode ctl. & cyclic acq fixes:
- documentation for new browser status line and 2 stats wins
- acq timebase for cycle stats in EpgDbGetStat()
- take tuner freq from obsolete db version also
- check if version is incompatible before recommending prov selection
- acqmode popup: check for device-access or no-tuner errors
- warn when acq mode not possible due to non-tuner input
- stats window: report acq mode, cycle phase and index

WIN32 port fixes:
- tuner input source fixed to #0
- CTRL-C, shutdown or abnormal termination crashes the host
- improve "Getting Started" in help for Win32
- dump stream feature: must use window or file instead of stdout



required fixes:
- EPG scan skips some channels with bad reception or encryption
- EPG scan summary: # of syncs found, # of EPG providers found
  Manual scan; ttx error rate in stats window
- short info text view is set to line 1.0 during every update
- suggest bttv driver fix: CGFREQ from tuner driver
- cmd line option predatory: in this mode the tuner is set via /dev/vbi
  regardless of other /dev/video users
- use frame counter at the end of the frame buffer
- latin-1 chars in substring search do not work with Tcl/Tk 8.3
- do not tune channel if vbi busy
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- improve sync with acq slave process:
  + acq abort: slave should pass errno as reason via shmem
  + sigchld -> acq off
  + check parent every 30 sec, also when no ttx reception
- count parity errors before replacing blocks of same version
- debugging: make serious debugX events fatal (developers only)

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- TV channel switching for NOW programmes with middle mouse button
- timezone popup (GUI already implemented)
- timer programming & invocation or external dispatch
- long-term search: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time
  new data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching PI arrives. This
  can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches
- multiple VBI devices (locally or in network)
