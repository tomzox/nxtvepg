This file contains a list of changes that are planned for the future.
No promises are made as to when I'll get to execute these changes.
Your feedback is always welcome, so feel free to mail me if you want to
boost any item's priority, find more points that need to be fixed or if
you have ideas for additional features.


acq mode ctl. & cyclic acq fixes:
- documentation for new browser status line and 2 stats wins
- acq timebase for cycle stats in EpgDbGetStat()
- 2nd stage after dbs are (almost) complete: concentrate on reaching
  100%, then sleep and just wake up to check AI, e.g. every 5 minutes
- check if version is incompatible before recommending prov selection
- limit number of error/warning popups for database errors
  or combine several CNIs into one popup

WIN32 port fixes:
- tuner input source fixed to #0
- dump stream feature: must use window or file instead of stdout
- catch exceptions in VBI thread separately (anyone still seeing blue-screens?)
- need to debug source of crash in MessageBox()
- better workaround for dynamic menus needed

required bttv driver fixes:
- setting input source via /dev/vbi is not possible
  (waiting for answer from Gerd Knorr to mail from Feb/21/2001)

merged database fixes:
- fine control for provider merge
  (e.g. average editorial rating instead of first)
- merged database: version & block index handling (for statistics)
- more intelligent redundancy check for merged descriptions:
  break up into substrings at any non-alnum except space

other required fixes:
- add manual EPG scan: direct input of channel and fine-tune or frequency
- short info text view is set to line 1.0 during every update
- cmd line option "predatory": in this mode the tuner is set via /dev/vbi
  regardless of other /dev/video users
- do not tune channel if vbi busy
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- improve sync with acq slave process:
  + acq abort: slave should pass errno as reason via shmem
  + sigchld -> acq off
  + check parent every 30 sec, also when no ttx reception
- debugging: make serious debugX events fatal (developers only)

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- Use Tix library to improve GUI
- add hyperlinks in the online help menus for all cross-references
- TV channel switching for NOW programmes
- timezone popup (GUI already implemented)
- timer programming and invocation or external dispatch
- wish list: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time new
  data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching programme is found
  for the first time. This can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches
- multiple VBI devices (locally or in network)
