fixes:
- do not tune channel if vbi busy
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- improve sync with acq slave process:
  + acq abort: slave should pass errno as reason via shmem
  + sigchld -> acq off
  + check parent every 30 sec, also when no ttx reception
- count parity errors before replacing blocks of same version
- debugging: make serious debugX events fatal (developers only)

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- cyclic acq: round robin of providers when 100% complete
- timer programming & invocation or external dispatch
- merge data of all providers into new database
  user may specify which categories to take from which provider,
  e.g. short&long info from 3SAT, series code from Pro7, rating from RTL2 etc.
- long-term search: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time
  new data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching PI arrives. This
  can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches
- multiple VBI devices (locally or in network)
