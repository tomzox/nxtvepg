boost any item's priority, find more points that need to be fixed or if
you have ideas for additional features.

Post-Nextview EPG:
- ttx-*.dat files do not contain configured page range 300-699
- New DB type: "Load Teletext EPG...": automatically follow TTX acq, even if DB not exist yet
- statistics display for concurrent grabbing
- extend XMLTV database statistics
  - pie chart: different color for current day
  - histogram, merged db: show percentage of DBs updated during last 12-24 hours
  - timescale: different color for DBs older than 12-24 hours
- move USE_TTX_GRABBER to exclude all acqusition if not set
- move PI expire config from dlg_filter into TTX grabber
- merge & load dialog: directory drop-down: add history
- merge dialog, "configure" sub-menu: simplify to single list with
  "extended" selection (i.e. allow multiple selections)
- remove use of PDC theme table: create table from themes found in XMLTV
- change AI/OI/PI to hold original XMLTV info elements (i.e. reduce conversion)
- xmltv-etsi.map: use .config/nxtvepg instead of "." in xmltv_cni.c
- DVB TTX stream decoding issues: "Illegal line order", "Unknown data_unit_id"
- DVB: automatic detection of teletext PID (in channel scan or otherwise)
- DVB-S support
- support more TV apps channel.conf
- XMLTV CNI mapping fundamentally broken
- mplayer, VLC & VDR plugin for EPG display
- teletext: use separate thread for post-processing (takes long time for 10 DBs)
- teletext: use mtime to determine start of acq
- teletext: use TV channel name as XMLTV display name
- teletext acq stats: percentage cycle loaded (i.e. cycles done vs. max. sub-page count)
- teletext configuration dialog channel-specific
- teletext emit XML encoding UTF-8

Missing documentation:
- TV Tune config in context menu dialog
- WDM and source "none" in Win32 TV card config dialog

Teletext grabber:
- improve TTX parser (-> failing parsertest pages)
- stats output:
  - describe errors (i.e. keep grabber's STDERR)  ? send to daemon ?
  - daemon send CNI or last processed DB to client (for stats popup only)
  ? stats popup show db stats of last processed XMLTV ?
    + channel ID & official name (e.g. ard.de - ARD)
    + number of newly captured pgrogrammes (# slots in overview)
      total number of available programmes (new & merged)
    + number of descriptions & unresolved TTX links
    + number of used overview pages
    + page range used for overview
    + sub-page depth of overview pages & descriptions
      percentag of multi-pages in overview and descriptions
- merge db open for acq:
  after merge db open failure: do not attempt to open same db again
- acq start: if last acq was aborted, continue seamless
  - determine age of XML files
  - determine delta between oldest and newest
    ? post-processing must "touch" files from channels with no reception ?
  - if age of newest is <2h and delta >2h (or acq cycle time?)
    -> mark newer ones done (or move them to the end?)
- passive acq mode for ttx grabber
  - start grabber after 30 sec (if in NOW phase), next after 2min (reuse data)
  ? stop grabbing after 2nd grabber start (don't waste CPU) ?
- ttxdecode: handle page range <800->800, i.e. split 700-799,000-099
- merge with old XMLTV file
  ? merge problem: how detect conflicts if programmes have no STOP time?
- reduce parity errors during repeated reception
  - both during XMLTV merge and VBI packet reception
- allow user to handle all TTX sources as one
  ? i.e. merge sources automatically ?
- check if all sub-pages are captured (on relevant pages only!)
  ? implement in nxtvepg or external post-processor ?
- make overview page range configurable?
- configure list of networks for ttx acq
- config dialog:
  - check if TV app is configured and channel table can be parsed
  - display channels which will be captured by name (e.g. "ARD - MTV")
  - configure database directory for generated XML output
    OR: use the same as for nextview EPG data
  ? separate channel list or at least channel count for Now/Next ?
- display EPG into in connected TV app, even if captured "late" from TTX

XMLTV import:
- get language from XMLTV input for SetUserLanguage(), "auto" mode
  for non-auto mode: pass language selection to XML parser;
  used by EpgSetup_GetDefaultLang(): pAiBlock->lang
- change max netwop count from 254 to dynamic? (high effort in epgfilter.h and epgdbmerge.c)
- programmes with start time only should not be discarded
  automatically set stop time to start of subsequent programme
- extend PI struct to hold all XMLTV info fields?
- theme codes: build custom theme table from theme string in XML file (?)
  problem #1: storing filter shortcuts (must store theme name, not index)
  problem #2: building theme main categories/hierarchy (e.g. movie/show/news)

XICCC TODO:
- large data transfers
- free data after reception
- remove dead peers from permanent station update queue

Reminders TODO:
- acq: update event timer for PI starting in +15 - minimal pre-offset
- fuzzy matching (for PI w/o PIL) to catch shifted start times
Possible future reminder options:
- allow to edit programme's reminder title (e.g. to add notes)?
  problem: disables possibility of fuzzy match on titles
- after manual repeat: remove single PI for shortcuts? (needs extra flag)
- state in reminder list: display min/hours/days until next event?
  (cumbersome since it requires to be updated every minute)
- snooze (i.e. repeat) for user-confirmed commands?
- include clock in reminder popup?
- allow to specify format (attribute selection) for reminder event popup and
  optionally include "short info" window in popups (i.e. description) (Jörk)
- use VPS/PDC to detect actual programme's start time
  problem: only possible while TV display switched off or on the same channel
  unless the user has multiple cards; even then coord. with acq. is required
- don't suppress outdated message for new reminder if it's the last one? (Peter)
- pass reminders to external scheduler immediately upon creation (Steffen)
  note: probably also pass removals and changes to external scheduler
- simplify use of shortcuts in reminders (e.g. combine shortcut creation
  with reminder addition in "Add reminder for filter" menu entry)

Recently suggested fixes & changes:
- TV app shm: resend info for same channel (req. by zoomin)
  also: add more EPG info to shared memory; add video norm to shm
  also: synchronize timer list with ZoomOut
  also: slicer type selection or better slicer in K!TV
  also: display reminders in K!TV (esp. in fullscreen mode; Denis Witt)
- single click on short-info size slider: resize by one line
- start time search: abs. stop time val "23:10" excludes titles starting at 23:10
- improve text search: keywords (google style AND), parity-safe/fuzzy
- parity-safe short/long info redundancy removal
- series filter based on title instead of provider-supplied series codes
  possibly allow manually maintained series list (i.e.title/CNIs couples)
- allow provider channel names at the -prov command line arg
- HTML dump: allow to specify which column to use for hyperlink?
- new PI column type which displays full weekday name (Thierry)
- graying out filtered programmes instead of removing them
- marking attributes which match current filter in the description window,
  esp. for text search (Volker Moell)
- allow multiple, non-continguous selections in shortcut & networks listbox
  without use of the keyboard (like in -selectmode multiple)
  (suggested via discussion forum by "Philippe")
- optionally hide short-info window -> display with double-click
- sort networks in merged provider database by default in the user-configured
  order of the merged providers; when adding a new provider to an merge
  config, append new networks to the merged db's network list
- add note to acq config dlg: does not affect display db
- weekday scale for grid layout: additional column (Thierry)
- split network prefilter into 2 parts: excluded and unlisted: latter ones are
  still part of filter menus and used for reminder shortcut matches
- add flag to shortcuts which enables "auto-selection" after filter reset: will
  allow pre-filtering for other criteria than networks (e.g. remove all sports)
- delayed rc/ini save after shortcut tree changes (e.g. folder open/close)
- vertical scrollbar for timescale window (forum 2003-12-31)
- option to ask before quitting nxtvepg with "X" window title bar button
  or to send to systray instead (forum 2004-01-16)
- bayesian filter to highlight programmes (forum 2004-03-20)
- free configuration of key and mouse bindings
- save system encoding setting at the time of rc writing into rc file
  so that correct conversion is used during reload
- add "Help" button to error popup messages
- epgdbfil.c: clean solution for text search string length limit


New "NetBox" layout: open issues/known problems:
- refresh may leave excessive gaps between items
- special marker row between different days?
- changing column count/width by resizing outer window?
- possible additional formatting options:
  + wrap text (e.g. for title, or even description)
  + align text: left/center/right

Acquisition daemon:
- when dump is aborted, keep the old modification time on client-side
- VPS: trigger check device access via remove cmd (upon xawtv start/exit)
- limit queue max length on server side (e.g. when bandwidth too low
  or client hangs)
- client-side db mgmt during dump state: lock merge & PI listbox?
optional:
- cmdline option -non-shared-dbdir: suck the complete db through the pipe
- avoid copying memory each forwarded EPG block for each connected client
win32 port:
- install daemon as a service, possibly with helper app. in the systray
  to check acquisition status.
- add support for named pipes as alternative to TCP/IP
- TV app interaction, at least to free the driver and use TV app for acq

xawtv TV app interaction:
- Tune-TV: warn if station name is not in .xawtv?
- Tune-TV: offer to start TV application if not running?
  may not work if app. requires command line options
- VPS empty/pause codes display

WIN32 port fixes:
- use TV app directory in shared memory for auto-configuration
- dump stream feature: must use window or file instead of stdout
  note: output to stdout works when started inside a GNU/Cygwin bash
- need to debug source of main window crash in Windows MessageBox()
- better workaround for dynamic menus (e.g. "Navigate" filer menu) needed
- allow manual horizontal resizing for grid layout
- menubutton popups does not work when invoked for the 2nd time via
  ALT key binding (Thierry)
- save main window position in INI file (when manually changed; Thierry)
- start with main window maximized when requested in Windows shortcut properties
  (requested by Thierry; I've no idea how to query these properties though)
- systray popup menu should close by any mouse click outside of it
- Tcl/Tk panic after desktop resulution change (e.g. to start fullscreen game)
  Tk panic in color palette handling, leads to program abort
  possibly use WM_DISPLAYCHANGE to restart
- catch WM_POWERBROADCAST, PBT_APMRESUMESUSPEND to catch power mode changes

WDM:
- DLL must not depend on proprietary MS DLL
- frequency mapping
- clean interface declaration: API.txt vs. WDMDRV.h
  API version control
- device path query function
- exception handling: call AcqStop regardles of current thread?
- sometimes crash at end or abort of EPG scan
- SelectDevice fails after unload/reload of DLL

merged database fixes:
- fine control for provider merge
  (e.g. average editorial rating instead of first)
- database statistics popup: need some estimation for % of completeness
- merged database: block index handling (for statistics)
- more intelligent redundancy check for merged descriptions:
  break up into substrings at any non-alnum except space
- user-defined mapping of CNIs in case of CNI mismatch between providers

other required fixes:
- epgdbmerge.c: AI merge: design fixes (don't modify caller's CNI array)
- advance ranges of expired PI in timescale popup every minute
- TI & LI (subtitle and language information blocks): implement output methods
  and search filters
- merge db: remove expired PI from db every minute
- automatically show expired PI in the database when still running
  (according to VPS/PDC) when following TV channel changes
- netwop name config: counts names to "automatic selection"
  even if there was just one provider (or just one with that netwop)
  note: no xawtv sync is done, so it must only appear if there's more than one provider
- during very bad reception acq restarts every 2-4 secs
  due to ttx page header decoding error (falsely detected channel change)
- AdvanceCyclePhase: limit number of tries to update provider (first "if")
- startup: if nxtvepg version is incompatible don't recommend prov selection

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- use Qt or GTK library instead of Tk to make GUI more pretty
  main problem: filter shortcut and configuration is implemented in Tcl
- allow acquisition from multiple TV cards and remote daemons
- export database content to mysql server (with updates during acquisition)
- dialogs, menus and help texts in German and French
- wish list: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time new
  data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching programme is found
  for the first time. This can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- wizard for initial configuration (esp. in Windows; suggested by "zoomin")
- highlight matching description text when using sub-string search filter
