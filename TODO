This file contains a list of changes that are planned for the future.
No promises are made as to when I'll get to execute these changes.
Your feedback is always welcome, so feel free to mail me if you want to
boost any item's priority, find more points that need to be fixed or if
you have ideas for additional features.


xawtv patches (Gerd Knorr)
- vtx: ESC codes for proportional font and possibly centering
- vtx: remove subtitles upon channel changes
- handle input source change as channel change, e.g. update property
- split multi-network station names prior to comparison in setstation_handler

nxtvepg xawtv.c:
- move xawtv description from configuration sections to separate chapter
- Netname Config Dialog: warn if Tune-TV if name is unknown
- allow obsolete PI in the browser window (for VPS)
- Tune-TV: offer to start xawtv if not running
  may not work if xawtv requires command line options
- VPS empty/pause codes display
- multi-network channel name splitting in property event handling
  NO - leads to annoying false guesses

acq mode ctl. & cyclic acq fixes:
- documentation for browser status line and 2 stats wins
- acq timebase for cycle stats in EpgDbGetStat()
- 2nd stage after dbs are (almost) complete: concentrate on reaching
  100%, then sleep and just wake up to check AI, e.g. every 5 minutes
- check if version is incompatible before recommending prov selection
- limit number of error/warning popups for database errors
  or combine several CNIs into one popup

WIN32 port fixes:
- input source naming needs to be configurable for exotic cards
- dump stream feature: must use window or file instead of stdout
- catch exceptions in VBI thread separately (anyone still seeing blue-screens?)
- need to debug source of crash in MessageBox()
- better workaround for dynamic menus needed

merged database fixes:
- fine control for provider merge
  (e.g. average editorial rating instead of first)
- merged database: version & block index handling (for statistics)
- more intelligent redundancy check for merged descriptions:
  break up into substrings at any non-alnum except space

other required fixes:
- fix: programmes that lie past a daylight saving time border are assigned
  a wrong start time on Linux (Linux lacks tm_isdst in struct tm)
- fix: obsolete series codes can not be deleted, because only series which
  have an instance in the db are listed in the series menu
- allow to set input source via /dev/vbi (bttv version >= 0.7.5x)
- cmd line option "predatory": in this mode the tuner is set via /dev/vbi
  regardless of other /dev/video users
- do not tune channel if vbi busy, because it disturbs e.g. a teletext app.
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- improve sync with acq slave process:
  + acq abort: slave should pass errno as reason via shmem
  + sigchld -> acq off
  + check parent every 30 sec, also when no ttx reception
- debugging: make serious debugX events fatal (developers only)

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- bookmarks with multiple priority levels and reminders for bookmarks above
  an adjustable priority level (raise popup or dispatch external app.)
- series management based on titles only, across all networks
- use GTK+ or Tix library to improve GUI
- allow multiple acquisition and GUI clients, possibly on different hosts
- export database content to mysql server
- help texts in German
- add hyperlinks in the online help menus for all cross-references
- timezone dialog (GUI already implemented)
- wish list: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time new
  data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching programme is found
  for the first time. This can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches
- multiple VBI devices (locally or in network)
