This file contains a list of changes that are planned for the future.
No promises are made as to when I'll get to execute these changes.
Your feedback is always welcome, so feel free to mail me if you want to
boost any item's priority, find more points that need to be fixed or if
you have ideas for additional features.


daemon:
- make concurrent updates of shared rc file safe (e.g. daemon writes provider freq)
  or use a different rc for acq parameters; currently data can be lost!
- when dump is aborted, keep the old modification time on client-side
- VPS: trigger check device access via remove cmd (upon xawtv start/exit)
- limit queue max length on server side (e.g. when bandwidth too low
  or client hangs)
- client-side db mgmt during dump state: lock merge & PI listbox?
optional:
- cmdline option -nodbdir: suck the complete db through the pipe
- avoid copying each forwarded EPG block for each client
win32 port:
- install daemon as a service, possibly with helper app. in the systray
  to check acquisition status.
- load winsock DLL dynamically or provide dummy DLL for Win95

Bugs reported by Jan:
- sometimes falsely detected "forced passive" after acq cycle advance

nxtvepg xawtv.c:
- allow expired PI in the browser window (for VPS)
- Tune-TV: warn if station name is not in .xawtv
- Tune-TV: offer to start xawtv if not running
  may not work if xawtv requires command line options
- VPS empty/pause codes display
- if no PIL available, check if packet 8/30/x display status text
  is available and match against EPG db titles

WIN32 port fixes:
- Bt8x8 driver: make video input matrix configurable
- Btx8x8 card auto-detection from bttv driver
- support for Secam/PAL multi-norm TV tuners
- use TV app directory in shm for auto-configuration
- dump stream feature: must use window or file instead of stdout
  note: output to stdout works when started inside a GNU/Cygwin bash
- need to debug source of main window crash in Windows MessageBox()
- better workaround for dynamic menus (e.g. "Navigate" filer menu) needed
- fill context menu config dialog with useful examples for Windows;
  do not use DOS shell to start applications, use CreateProcess instead;
  do not use Bourne shell quoting
- prevent manual horizontal resizing (esp. during window maximize)

merged database fixes:
- fine control for provider merge
  (e.g. average editorial rating instead of first)
- database statistics popup: need some estimation for % of completeness
- merged database: block index handling (for statistics)
- more intelligent redundancy check for merged descriptions:
  break up into substrings at any non-alnum except space

other required fixes:
- epgdbmerge.c: AI merge: design fixes (don't modify caller's CNI array)
- advance ranges of expired PI in timescale popup every minute
- epgblock.h: make use of latest additions to PI: series_code, block_no_in_ai
- TI & LI (subtitle and language information blocks): implement output methods
  and search filters
- merge db: remove expired PI from db every minute
- netwop name config: counts names to "automatic selection"
  even if there was just one provider (or just one with that netwop)
  note: no xawtv sync is done, so it must only appear if there's more than one provider
- during very bad reception acq restarts every 2-4 secs
  due to ttx page header decoding error (falsely detected channel change)
- AdvanceCyclePhase: limit number of tries to update provider (first "if")
- improve VBI/TTX decoder: use code from aletv
- improve streams decoder hamming error handling: assemble AI block
  from multiple instances if neccessary
- add decoding error statistics to epgdbacq (e.g. # of dropped blocks)
- fix: external mode & tuner input source -> nonsense as status output
- fix: obsolete series codes can not be deleted, because only series which
  have an instance in the db are listed in the series menu
- fix: series filter uses netwop index; in a merged db when the netwop
  selection is changed the indices change -> shortcuts with series useless
  must use CNI instead of netwop index in shortcuts
- startup: if nxtvepg version is incompatible don't recommend prov selection
- allow to set input source via /dev/vbi (bttv version >= 0.7.5x)
- cmd line option "predatory": in this mode the tuner is set via /dev/vbi
  regardless of other /dev/video users
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- filter for min/max duration of shows
- bookmarks with multiple priority levels and reminders for bookmarks above
  an adjustable priority level (raise popup or dispatch external app.)
- series management based on titles only, across all networks
- use GTK+ or Tix library to improve GUI
- allow multiple acquisition and GUI clients, possibly on different hosts
- export database content via HTTP
- export database content to mysql server
- dialogs, menus and help texts in German and French
- add hyperlinks in the online help menus for all cross-references
- wish list: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time new
  data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching programme is found
  for the first time. This can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
