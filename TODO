This file contains a list of changes that are planned for the future.
No promises are made as to when I'll get to execute these changes.
Your feedback is always welcome, so feel free to mail me if you want to
boost any item's priority, find more points that need to be fixed or if
you have ideas for additional features.

daemon:
- auto-enable for daemon mode is set too soon when connected via TCP/IP;
  must wait until connect finished in the background
- "cannot start scan while in client/server mode"
  even while not connected
- make concurrent updates of shared rc file safe (e.g. daemon writes provider freq)
  or use a different rc for acq parameters; currently data can be lost!
- when dump is aborted, keep the old modification time on client-side
- VPS: trigger check device access via remove cmd (upon xawtv start/exit)
- limit queue max length on server side (e.g. when bandwidth too low
  or client hangs)
- client-side db mgmt during dump state: lock merge & PI listbox?
options:
- cmdline option -nodbdir: suck the complete db through the pipe
- avoid copying each forwarded EPG block for each client

misc:
- epgdbmerge.c: AI merge: design fixes (don't modify caller's CNI array)
- advance ranges of expired PI in timescale popup every minute
- epgblock.h: make use of latest additions
- merge db: remove expired PI from db every minute
- netwop name config: counts names to "automatic selection"
  even if there was just one provider (or just one with that netwop)
  note: no xawtv sync is done, so it must only appear if there's more than one provider
- Canal+ only found in EPG scan when in slow mode
- remove ulong in frequencies

Bugs reported by Jan:
- sometimes falsely detected "forced passive" after acq cycle advance
- wheel mouse: scroll less than 1 page; keep Cursor on the same item

xawtv patches (Gerd Knorr)
- vtx: ESC codes for proportional font and possibly centering
- vtx: remove subtitles upon channel changes
- handle input source change as channel change, e.g. update property
- split multi-network station names prior to comparison in setstation_handler

nxtvepg xawtv.c:
- allow expired PI in the browser window (for VPS)
- Tune-TV: warn if station name is not in .xawtv
- Tune-TV: offer to start xawtv if not running
  may not work if xawtv requires command line options
- VPS empty/pause codes display

WIN32 port fixes:
- TV card input dialog: warn if TV app changed but config not loaded
- read VPS/PDC from TV app even if acq is OFF or uses different card
  + use "is connected" instead of "acq passive" to decide if wait for VPS
  + btdrv4win: do not check isEnabled; always do VBI acq for VPS/PDC!
- prevent EPG scan while TV app connected OR adapt video signal detection
  and add EPG syntax scanner into TV app
- improve TTX stats: 1. running average of ttx pkg data rate 2. error
  stats to estimate reception quality
- option "hide on minimize": add task bar icon
- Bt8x8: make video input matrix configurable
- dump stream feature: must use window or file instead of stdout
- need to debug source of crash in MessageBox()
- better workaround for dynamic menus needed

open points dsdrv:
- must be able to load driver multiply in different apps
- need portable card IDs, i.e. PCI slot, so to allow comm. between apps.
     m_SubSystemId = 0x13eb0070
     m_BusNumber = 0
     m_SlotNumber = 18

merged database fixes:
- fine control for provider merge
  (e.g. average editorial rating instead of first)
- database statistics popup: need some estimation for % of completeness
- merged database: block index handling (for statistics)
- more intelligent redundancy check for merged descriptions:
  break up into substrings at any non-alnum except space

other required fixes:
- btdrv4linux: thread mode: signla HUP to slave thread is lost
- during very bad reception acq restarts every 2-4 secs
  due to ttx page header decoding error (falsely detected channel change)
- AdvanceCyclePhase: limit number of tries to update provider (first "if")
- improve VBI/TTX decoder: use code from aletv
- improve streams decoder hamming error handling: assemble AI block
  from multiple instances if neccessary
- add decoding error statistics to epgdbacq (e.g. # of dropped blocks)
- external mode & tuner input source -> nonsense as status output
- fix: obsolete series codes can not be deleted, because only series which
  have an instance in the db are listed in the series menu
- fix: series filter uses netwop index; in a merged db when the netwop
  selection is changed the indices change -> shortcuts with series useless
  must use CNI instead of netwop index in shortcuts
- startup: if nxtvepg version is incompatible don't recommend prov selection
- allow to set input source via /dev/vbi (bttv version >= 0.7.5x)
- cmd line option "predatory": in this mode the tuner is set via /dev/vbi
  regardless of other /dev/video users
- filter shortcut combination logic modes: OR,AND
- provider-specific shortcuts: are listed only for one provider
  mandatory when shortcut includes series or sortcrit filter
- improve sync with acq slave process:
  + acq abort: slave should pass errno as reason via shmem
  + sigchld -> acq off
  + check parent every 30 sec, also when no ttx reception

possible new features: (in order of decreasing priority)
- wheel mouse: make scroll speed configurable
- network selection: allow to specify time windows, e.g. for ARTE 19:00-06:00
- additional dump format: as text with TABS as separators
- bookmarks with multiple priority levels and reminders for bookmarks above
  an adjustable priority level (raise popup or dispatch external app.)
- series management based on titles only, across all networks
- use GTK+ or Tix library to improve GUI
- allow multiple acquisition and GUI clients, possibly on different hosts
- export database content via HTTP
- export database content to mysql server
- help texts in German
- add hyperlinks in the online help menus for all cross-references
- timezone dialog (GUI already implemented)
- wish list: maintain list of search filters that are applied each time new
  data has been acquired; notify the user when a matching programme is found
  for the first time. This can be used for a list of favourite movies or actors
- links to Internet Movie Database from titles and actor's names
  main difficulties: finding out the original title from the national AKA
  and fuzzy-matching actor's names in the description
- provider selection: display db age & fill percentage
  save stats and start time of 1st PI in db header
- navigation: disable leafs with zero PI / display number of matches
- multiple VBI devices (locally or in network)
