<H1>Questions &amp; answers on Windows TV app. interaction</H1>
<P>
The following is from a mail I sent to DScaler developers (see also this
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=727665&group_id=7420&atid=357420">RFE</A>),
but since I did not hear back from them and this will apply equivalently to all
M$ Windows TV applications I've included it here.
</P>

<DL>
<DT>Q: How much effort is involved on the side of TV applications?
<DD><P>
It should be fairly easy, since there's demo/reference
clients and test applications (tvsim, vbirec) with all the necessary
interface code, as well as the <A HREF="http://www.kastortv.org/">K!TV</A>
Nextview plugin as an example. The protocol between TV app and nxtvepg
is not complex at all - based on shared memory and event triggers - so
you'll probably be able to understand it almost immediately.
</P><P>
The source code for the demo interface isn't cleanly packaged yet (most
of it is in one file: tvsim/winshmclnt.c, but VBI acquisition code is
shared with the nxtvepg sources in epgvbi and epgdb subdirectories), but
I can provide you with that and also write more documentation.  In
essence, you would need to add a few function calls at the right places
in the TV app (e.g. one during startup, one for every channel change, one
for every VBI line) and an event handler which processes incoming
messages, most importantly EPG information (see WINSHMCLNT_EVENT in
winshmclnt.h)  Note the TV app does not need to deal with the shared
memory directly, as there are interface functions to update or query
contents.
</P><P>
The effort depends on how many features you want to support and how
well. A few hours only is probably unrealistic, but it shouldn't take
more than a few days, including testing. The full set of features would be:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>nxtvepg attach/detach (mandatory): upon application startup the TV app
triggers an event and waits for nxtvepg to free the TV card if necessary

<LI>VBI forwarding: allows Nextview acquisition when a provider channel
is tuned in (Canal+ in F, Kabel1 and RTL2 in D (available on ASTRA
satellite), SF1 in CH); also supports channel identification for
EPG OSD.

<LI>EPG OSD in the TV picture: after each channel change the EPG app is
triggered to provide programme title, running times etc. for display in
TV app's OSD; nxtvepg will also highlight the current programme in its
TV schedules.

<LI>remote control of the TV app by the EPG app: supports channel switches
by double-clicking an entry in the TV schedules plus further optional
commands which can be hooked into nxtvepg's context menu or reminder
scripts, e.g. to start a recording.

<LI>granting tuner: while the TV app is minimized or paused it can grant
the TV tuner to nxtvepg to allow to switch to the Nextview provider
channel to update the EPG database.
</UL>
<P>
Most of these features can be demonstrated by <A HREF="tvsim.html">tvsim</A>.
</P>

<DT>Q: How much adaptions are required for VBI forwarding?
<DD><P>
Note that VBI forwarding is optional.  But since the effort is low
and it makes EPG OSD more reliable (at least for channels which
support VPS/PDC) I'd highly recommend to include it.
</P><P>
The simplest way would be to include the nxtvepg slicer and pass it
every VBI scan line. The interface module would then slice the data,
filter for EPG teletext packets and VPS/PDC and pass that to nxtvepg
through a ring buffer in shared memory.  Alternatively you can pass
already sliced data, e.g. for teletext a 40 byte array plus decoded
page/packet number.  I don't think any special conversions would be
required in the TV app.  You can use the
<A HREF="vbirec.html">vbirec tool</A>
to test if VPS/PDC and teletext are decoded and received correctly
at the remote side of shared memory.
</P>

<DT>Q: What information does nxtvepg provide in return?
<DD><P>
nxtvepg fills a structure in shared memory with the current
channel's program title, start/stop time and theme codes (movie, series
etc.)  This info is intended for OSD. nxtvepg can also provide it's
entire database in XMLTV or plain text format.
