<H1>X11 TV application communication protocols</H1>
<P>
This page briefly describes the two protocols which allow communication
between nxtvepg and X11 TV applications to provide EPG information or
remote control.
</P><P>
This documented is intended for software developers.  Readers should have
experience with programming X clients at Xlib level, i.e. they should at
least be familiar with the concept of X event handling and what windows
and atoms represent at this level.
This document is not intended to be a formal specification.
</P>

<H2>Xawtv protocol</H2>
<P>
This protocol is based on remote control mechanisms implemented in
<A HREF="http://bytesex.org/xawtv/">Xawtv</A>.
They allow to capture the currently tuned station and station
changes and to send generic remote commands to xawtv.  Since the
protocol predates nxtvepg there's no support for EPG specifically.
</P>

<H3>Messages</H3>
<P>
Communication is based on 3 X atoms which all must be placed in the
TV application's toplevel window (i.e. the topmost one below the
window manager's decorative frames)
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>WM_CLASS</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Contains the name of the application (e.g. "Xawtv")  When searching
    for a peer, nxtvepg examines every toplevel window for this atom and
    compares the value with a list of known application names.  The list
    has to be extended for each new TV application.
</P></DD>
<DT><B>_XAWTV_STATION</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Describes the TV station currently tuned by the TV application.
    Contains 3 strings, each terminated by zero bytes:
    TV frequency in kHz, channel name, station name.
    This atom must be updated by the TV application upon every channel
    change, since nxtvepg uses property change events to monitor for
    channel changes.
</P></DD>
<DT><B>_XAWTV_REMOTE</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    This atom is used to pass commands from remote applications to Xawtv.
    The command name and parameters are passed as zero-separated strings.
    The following commands are used by nxtvepg:
    </P>

    <TR><TD><KBD>message ...</KBD><TD>Display the given message (e.g. in the window title bar or inside the TV video display)
    </TBODY>
    </TABLE>
    <P>
    To invoke a command it's simply written into the atom by means of
    XChangeProperty(), which triggers a property change event in the
    TV application.  There's no confirmation sent back to nxtvepg to
    indicate if the command was sucessfully executed.
</P></DD>
</DL>
<H3>Procedures</H3>
<P>
When nxtvepg is started it first scans all existing toplevel windows
for known WM_CLASS names.  If one is found, the window ID is stored.
If not, nxtvepg registers for sub-structure notify events on the
root window and checks WM_CLASS on all newly created toplevel windows.
(This procedure is the main weakness of this protocol, since both the
initial scan and the monitoring cause an unnecessary load on the X
server.  Note that not only application main windows are toplevel windows,
but also every dialog, popup menu or even tool-tip.)
<P></P>
While nxtvepg is "connected" to a TV app (i.e. a valid window ID is
known) it monitors for property change events on the STATION atom.
After every change it reads the station name from the atom and matches
it against the internal network name list.  If a match is found, or if
the station can be identified by means of VPS/PDC capture, EPG info is
sent back to the TV application.
(Note by default nxtvepg does not use the "message" command to display
EPG information since it doesn't look very nice in xawtv.  Instead it
generates a small popup window by itself and just positions it close to
the TV application's window.)
<P></P>
While nxtvepg is "connected", the user also has the possibility to
remote control the TV application.  Most importantly he/she can
generate "setstation" commands simply by double-clicking a programme
entry.
<P></P>
nxtvepg learns about termination of the TV application by receiving
a destroy event for the TV app's toplevel window.  Note the TV app
has no means to know if nxtvepg is connected.
</P>

<H2>ICCC selection manager protocol</H2>
<P>
The second communication protocol supported by nxtvepg (starting with version 2.8.0)
is derived from the <I>Selection Manager</I> protocol specified in the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.6/xc/doc/hardcopy/ICCCM/icccm.PS.gz">Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</A>,
version 2.  Note that despite the protocol's name it's not limited to
the exchange of copy/paste text buffers.  See also
<A HREF="http://freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</A>
for other examples how the protocol is used (e.g in the systray protocol)
</P><P>
This protocol is in some ways similar to the Xawtv protocol, since it also
uses atoms for message transport and - at least for now - the same messages
are exchanged.  The main differences are firstly the use of the X11 selection
mechanism to simplify and speed up the search for peers, and secondly that
the connection is bidirectional and generally more robust.
</P>

<H3>Procedures</H3>
<P>
Initially, each peer must create an X window which is only used to manage
the selection.  An atom is placed on this window which identifies the peer
either as an EPG or a TV application.  Other atoms which are used for
data transfer and explained in the next chapter are also placed here.
</P><P>
The application then can search for a compatible peer. This is done by
a single call of the XGetSelectionOwner() function.  If sucessful, the
function returns the peer's selection window ID.  If not, the client
listens for client messages on the root window, to receive broadcast
messages which are sent when a new manager starts (see next paragraph.)
</P><P>
To be able to receive messages from peers, an application must register
as <I>selection manager</I> with function XSetSelectionOwner().  Only then
others can find it with XGetSelectionOwner().  nxtvepg always registers
as manager, but for TV applications it's optional.  Applications which
only want to query EPG infos need not become manager.  However it's required
to become manager if a TV app also wants to allow remote control (e.g.
changing channels from inside nxtvepg)
</P><P>
Multiple instances can be active on both sides: if you start nxtvepg
several times (possibly on different hosts, but with the same -tvdisplay)
only the first one will serve EPG queries and follow station changes of
TV apps.  The other instances still can send remote commands to the TV apps
though.  Another nxtvepg instance will automatically take over management
if the previous manager is terminated.  If multiple TV apps are active,
they should sort out among themselves which one is manager.
</P><P>
Communication follows a query/response model: the client first assigns
request parameters to one atom, then sends a selection request message
to the peer's manager window. After processing the request, the peer
assigns a possible result value to another atom and replies with a
selection notify event.  Note that all atoms are placed on the client's
selection window.  This way multiple client requests can be processed
in parallel.  The extra selection request/notify messages are used (in
contrary to property change events in Xawtv) to support large data
transfers in multiple chunks.  Theoretically a client can request the
entire EPG database.
</P><P>
<STRONG>Important</STRONG>: nxtvepg's implementation as described above
slightly differs from the ICCC specification. In the spec the same atom
is used for parameters and response, so clients have to wait for a response
before they can send the next query.  To simplify station change handling
nxtvepg departs from that, i.e. allows overlapping requests.  Only the
last request to the same target (see next chapter) will be answered for
each client.
</P>

<H3>Messages</H3>
<P>
The following is a list of the atoms used for data exchange.
Arguments are zero-separated strings.
</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>_NXTVEPG_SELECTION_MANAGER</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Identifier for nxtvepg's selection window, i.e. used by the TV application
    during connection establishment in search for the nxtvepg client.  It's
    automatically set on the selection window during initialisation.
    The value is a zero separated list of:
    protocol version (<KBD>NETAIP/1.0</KBD> for the current version),
    application name, application version, feature bits (currently always 0).
    The application is intended to be displayed to the user (e.g. is display
    of the connection status) but not evaluated by nxtvepg.
</P></DD>
<DT><B>_NXTVEPG_TV_CLIENT_MANAGER</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Identifier for the TV application's selection window, i.e. used by
    nxtvepg in search for TV clients.
    The value is the same as in the previous atom.
</P></DD>
<DT><B>_NXTVEPG_SETSTATION</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Used to send "setstation" messages to an EPG peer which signal a channel
    change and request a reply of EPG information for the new channel.
    Applications should not manipulate this property's value directly, but use
    function <I>Xiccc_SendQuery</I> instead.  The property is assigned channel
    information and parameters for the EPG request in form of zero-separated
    strings which contain:</P>
    <OL>
    <LI>Protocol identifier (always <KBD>NETAIP/1.0</KBD>)
    <LI>Channel name (e.g. "ARD"),
    <LI>Frequency in kHz,
    <LI>Channel name (e.g. "SE10"),
    <LI>VPS/PDC channel ID (CNI, e.g. 0xD92 for German network "Kabel1"),
    <LI>Requested EPG format (always "TAB" currently),
    <LI>Count of requested EPG programmes,
    <LI>update flag
    </OL>
    <P>
    When the update flag is set, unsolicited selection notification are
    sent by nxtvepg when new programmes start on the channel, or if another
    TV applications changes the channel.</P>
</P></DD>
<DT><B>_NXTVEPG_SETSTATION_RESULT</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    This atom is used to receive replies to the above setstation message,
    i.e. EPG information.  Basically the client could use any other atom
    for this, this specific name is just what's used by the code in xiccc.
    In contrary to Xawtv the client should not use property change events
    for notification if incoming events, but instead wait for selection
    notify events.  (This is required because the remote peer may write
    the property's data in several chunks.)
</P></DD>
<DT><B>_NXTVEPG_REMOTE</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Used to send all other kinds of messages between peers.  It's always a
    number zero-separated strings (note the last string should be terminated
    with a single zero.)  The first element is the name of the command, the
    rest is parameters and depends on the type of command.  Default commands
    which should be supported by all TV apps are the same as for
    <I>_XAWTV_REMOTE</I>.  Actually, the content of this property is identical
    to Xawtv.
</P></DD>
<DD><P>
<DT><B>_NXTVEPG_REMOTE_RESULT</B></DT>
<DD><P>
    Used to receive replies to remote commands.  The content depends on the
    request, but peers should always send at least a status code back.
</P></DD>
</DL>

<H3>Reference Implementation</H3>
<P>
The following is a short description of the reference implementation in
source module <KBD>epgui/xiccc.c</KBD>  Note it's not intended as a library,
you may have to slightly adapt the function interfaces to your requirements.
</P><P>
Most functions are asynchronous.  For example, when sending a message to
a peer, the reply is not yet available when the function returns. Instead
you must install an event handler which will be invoked when a reply
arrives, or other relevant events occur.
</P><P>
Since the protocol is based on Xlib directly, you need to install an
event handler which receives all X events, called "low-level" in the
following.  The xiccc module will filter out protocol events and pass
everything else (keyboard input events etc.) on to your toolkit library.
Events which should be handled by the application (e.g. incoming messages)
are signaled by means of a bitfield and message queues.  The application
should normally not process them directly in the X event handler since
it might interfer with your toolkit's event processing.  Instead a
"high-level" handler should be triggered which is then invoked as a
regular toolkit event.
</P><P>
In addition, event processing in the "high-level" handler requires
to install at least temporarily an X11 error handler which ignores
"Bad Window" errors which might be caused when accessing resources
of remote peers which have been been terminated.
</P><P>
A typical protocol client will look like this (not showing application
specific functionality):
</P>

<UL>
<LI><I>During application startup phase</I><BR>
    <UL>
    <LI>Install a handler which receives all X input events
    <LI>Install a "high-level" event handler which can be triggered by the low-level handler.

    <LI>Xiccc_Initialize(&amp;xiccc, dpy, TRUE, pIdArgv, idLen);
    <LI>Xiccc_ClaimManagement(&amp;xiccc, FALSE);
    <LI>Xiccc_SearchPeer(&amp;xiccc);
        <BR>note these functions may already raise events,
        <BR>hence check event bits and trigger high-level handler if necessary
    </UL>
<LI><I>main task event loop</I>
    <UL>
    <LI>In the X input event handler: pass all events to Xiccc_XEvent()<BR>
        Check for high-level events in the bit mask and trigger the high-level handler, if neccessary
    <LI>In the high-level handler, first call Xiccc_HandleInternalEvent()<BR>
        Process application events, as necessary (e.g. display EPG info on-screen; see list below)
    <LI>Report TV station changes to EPG app by sending SETSTATION messages
    </UL>

<LI><I>During application shutdown phase</I><BR>
    <UL>
    <LI>Xiccc_Destroy(&amp;xiccc);
    </UL>
</UL>

<P>
The following events may be generated by xiccc and should be handled by
the application in the "high-level" event handler.
