<H1>2.6.0 pre-releases change log</H1>
<P>
This page summarizes changes between pre-releases which led to the 2.6.0 release.
It's only kept for historical interest as the main change log summarizes all changes
that finally went into 2.6.0.  See also the nxtvepg
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=14102">mailing list archives</A>.
</P><P>
Note the format of rc/ini file has changed in 2.6.0pre0, 2.6.0pre3 and 2.6.0pre4;
it will be automatically upgraded (upgrade from pre2 to pre3 was broken though,
sorry) upon the first start when using an rc/ini file written by an
older version.  Make a copy before so you can still use it with older versions.
</P><P>
Note: due to changes in the acquisition statistics structures
in versions 2.6.0pre2 and pre7 the daemon is no longer compatible with
repective earlier versions of the nxtvepg GUI and vice versa.
</P>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre6 and 2.6.0pre7 (RC3)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed two sloppy bugs in Windows port of pre6: Tcl errors occurred
  when the new datescale format configuration was used and whenever
  a reminder message popup was displayed.
  Thanks to Peter for reporting these bugs.
<LI>Added configuration dialog for expire "cut-off" time (i.e. delay
  after which expired programmes are removed from the database):
  as sub-dialog to expire time filter dialog
<LI>Fixed timescales: enlarge length of scales according to configured
  expire removal delay
<LI>Windows: fixed bug in database directory handling: startup was
  aborted if the directory was the root of a mounted share
  (e.g. //remotehost/share)  Thanks to Manuel for reporting this bug.
<LI>Fixed compatibility of client/server protocol for different compiler
  versions (e.g. between gcc-3.3 and gcc-2.95)
<LI>Improved auto-start capabilities for daemon via control menu: also
  offer to start daemon if server hostname matches local host name,
  i.e. not only if server hostname is "localhost"
<LI>Cleaned up handling of start of a 2nd instance of nxtvepg: display
  only one message instead of multiple meaningless warnings.
  Thanks to Thierry for suggesting this improvement.
<LI>Windows: added auto-detection of Hauppauge WinTV GO
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre5 and 2.6.0pre6 (RC2)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Reminder popup window was invisible (placed off-screen) when nxtvepg
  main window was minimized at the time of the event
<LI>Reminder message popup window did not stay on top
<LI>Bold text format in user-defined columns disappeared during upgrade
  from nxtvepg versions &lt;= 2.5.2
<LI>Allow to specify date format and scale width in weekday scale
  via resource file (see nxtvepg.ad)
<LI>Windows: suppress DOS console when starting commands from context
  menus or as reminder script
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre4 and 2.6.0pre5 (RC1)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Added new programme list attribute type "weekday color", i.e. use
  colors (same as in weekday scale) to mark programmes instead of words
  "Fri" etc.  Thanks to Peter Rolf for the idea.  Note: for the grid
  layout this attribute isn't supported very well yet. Suggestions for
  improvement are welcome.
<LI>Extended start time filter: in addition to "daily" and "relative day
  offset" new modes "weekly" and "monthly" are supported; also date
  range for relative offsets was extended from 1 to 2 weeks.
<LI>Added new command line option -daemonstop: terminate daemon process
  to simplify controlling acquisition by use of scripts, esp. on Win32
<LI>Partly reverted pre3 change for context menu commands: on UNIX always
  use quotes because there are many special chars (e.g. &amp;, $, etc.)
  On Win32 use backslash before blanks instead of quotes.
<LI>Removed debug output for teletext reception errors on request by
  Thierry (based on new compile switch DEBUG_SWITCH_STREAM)
<LI>Fixed compatibility of btdrv4linux.c with libzvbi (Linux only)
<LI>Internal changes in Tcl script compilation (tcl2c.c preprocessor)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre3 and 2.6.0pre4</H3>
<UL>
<LI>fixed upgrade of rc/ini files from pre2 release (error message about
  missing "rempilist_colsize" variable)
<LI>bugfix in reminder message popup handling: if there was more than one
  event due for display, only the first (oldest) was actually displayed
<LI>fixed reminder group config: changes in group order or group deletions
  don't have unexpected side-effects anymore
<LI>plus some fixes in reminder handling (one might have caused a crash,
  i.e. Tcl internal panic, others caused Tcl error messages)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre2 and 2.6.0pre3</H3>
<UL>
<LI>implemented "repeat" and "suppress" controls for reminder messages
<LI>added "state" column to "edit reminders" dialog to display suppress
  and repeat status, and a context menu to manipulate the state
<LI>extended reminder main menu: allow to select reminder group for
  additions, or change the group for existing reminders
<LI>added weekday scale to the right of the programme list (note colors
  are configurable via the nxtvepg.ad file or X resources on UNIX)
<LI>user-configured commands in context menu: omit quotes around command
  substitutions unless there's whitespace (requested by "progro")
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre1 and 2.6.0pre2</H3>
<UL>
<LI>bugfix in aquisition statistics for new expire time handling (should
  be back to max. 100% now); also fixed "today" and "now" in date/time
  pulldown menus for use while expired programmes are listed.
<LI>optimized text search filter for case insensitive searches; also
  optimized programme list in general for complex filters (single list
  layout only; grid should be less problematic anyways since the listing
  is usually restricted to a few networks)
<LI>increased length of search text history in text search filter dialog
<LI>improved search text "paste" dialog; allow to read text from a file
<LI>compound attribute configuration dialog: added possibility to change
  background color for a single column only.
<LI>bugfix: suppressed reminders are no longer deleted when saving a new
  reminder group config.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.6.0pre0 and 2.6.0pre1</H3>
<UL>
<LI>"Tune TV" button in reminder message popup windows;
<LI>allow background color setting for images in compund attributes;
<LI>added shortcut combination modes "OR" and "AND" which keep filter of
  these shortcuts separately instead of merging them all into one as
  before.  This allows logical OR or AND between complex shortcuts,
  i.e. "movies on net A" OR "series on network B".  With merge you'd
  have got "movies or series on network A or B"; see manual chapter
  "Filter shortcuts" for more details.
<LI>improved text search dialog (yet again): active searches are now
  displayed in a list above the test entry field. There's also a
  sub-dialog which allows to paste multiple search texts at once
  (i.e. a list of movie titles)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.5.2 and 2.6.0pre0</H3>
<UL>
<LI>implemented reminders, i.e. bookmarking and message/command dispatch for
  selected programmes or shortcuts (see TODO list for open points)
<LI>free choice of colors in "compound attributes" (user-defined columns and
  grid elements).  Thanks to Peter Rolf for suggesting this improvement.
  Also added a new format type "background color" which changes the
  background of the entire column/grid element.  Possible extension is
  a format spec for background definition of the given column only.
  Also note that background colors given on image elements are currently
  ignored.
<LI>added possibility to invoke Xawtv remote commands via the programme list's
  context menu, by use of prefix !xawtv!  (e.g. switch the channel to the
  selected title with command: !xawtv! setstation ${network})
<LI>added new key binding for key "i": display EPG info just like upon a
  channel change in a connected TV application.
<LI>added an expire time filter to the filter menu, i.e. the possibility to
  display descriptions of TV shows which have already finished.  Still TODO
  is a possibility to configure the cut-off time when expired PI are removed
  from the database.  Currently this value can be changed in the rc/ini file
  by assigning a value (in minutes) to piexpire_cutoff; default: 4 hours.
  Note large values introduce performance penalities.
<LI>bugfix for possible crash when opening the alphabetical series list in
  the filter menu (mainly a problem on 64bit platforms.)
  Thanks to Helge Kreutzmann for the bug report.
