<H1>Nextview EPG Decoder Download Page</H1>
</CENTER>
In this software package you find a decoder for Nextview - an Electronic TV
Programme Guide for the analog domain (as opposed to the various digital EPGs
that come with most digital broadcasts). It allows you to receive and browse
free TV programme listings for all of the major networks in Germany, Austria,
France and Switzerland. You can have a look at it in this
<A HREF="screenshot.gif">Linux screenshot</A>, or this
<A HREF="screenshot-win.gif">Windows screenshot</A>.
<P>
The Nextview standard was developed by the major European consumer electronics
manufacturers under the hood of the <A HREF="http://www.etsi.org/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</A> (ETSI)
in 1995-1997 with the aim to offer an "electronic TV magazine" inside their
analog TV sets.  The transmission protocol is based on teletext, however
using a compact binary format instead of preformatted text pages. The advantage
compared to paper-based TV magazines is that you have an immediate overview
what's running <I>Now &amp; Next</I>, plus you can search through the programme
database by many different filter categories.
<P>
Now the <I>nxtvepg</I> software allows you to use Nextview with your PC too,
and adds a lot of features that would not be possible to implement inside a TV set.
The only preconditions are (a) that you have a TV tuner card for TV reception
inside your PC and (b) that you receive one of the Nextview content provider's
TV channels.
<P>
Currently Nextview EPG is transmitted by the following TV stations:
<DL>
<LI>in Germany and Austria: Pro7, 3Sat, RTL-II.
<LI>in Switzerland: EuroNews, TSR1 and others.
<LI>in France: Canal+, M6, TV5.
</DL>
<P>
If you don't receive any of these, then unfortunately this software is
useless to you, except for a demo mode. For detailed information please
refer to the <A HREF="man.html">nxtvepg manual page</A>.
<P>
If you're interested in buying a TV with Nextview inside, look for it
