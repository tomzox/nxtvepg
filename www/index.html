<BR>Browser for TV schedules in XMLTV format</SPAN></H1>

<P>
Welcome to the homepage of the <I>nxtvepg</I> software package, a browser for
TV programme schedules (EPG) stored in <A HREF="http://xmltv.org/">XMLTV</A>
format. nxtvepg supports flexible merging EPG from multiple sources and
displaying the result in a compact table view, or a grid view. It supports
filtering the TV schedule based on a large number of attributes, a filter
shortcut list in the main window, adding custom columns to the view to mark
programmes matching predefined filters, and reminders for individual programmes
or filter shortcuts.
</P><P>
nxtvepg also features an integrated Teletext EPG grabber, which uses a TV
capture card for automatically extracting TV schedules from programme tables in
Teletext from a given list of channels. Acquired EPG data can be merged and
browsed immediately in the nxtvepg GUI, or exported to files in XMLTV format
for use in another browser. Currently, the list of
<A HREF="provnets.html">well-supported TV networks</A> consists mainly of
German TV networks. Support for other networks can be easily added on request,
provided they transmit Teletext with useful TV schedules.
</P><P>
<BR>
<I>History</I>: From 2000-2008 nxtvepg was originally developed for receiving
and browsing Nextview EPG, which was an European standard for transmission
of Electronic TV Program Guides within analog TV broadcasts. However, as the
world has switched to digital TV broadcast since, it is no longer transmitted
today. Therefore, support for this standard has been removed from nxtvepg in
release 3.0.

<H2><A NAME="releases">New release 3.1 (Jul/23/2023)</A></H2>
<P>
Focus of this release are extensions to the support of the XMLTV specification
and thus to the information available for display in the GUI. Additionally,
a number of bugs in the GUI were fixed.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Theme category handling was enhanced to support this attribute exactly as
  present in XMLTV files: The pre-defined theme category table was replaced by
  a table that is created dynamically from the categories present in the loaded
  XMLTV file. A new filter dialog was added which can be used for browsing the
  list of all defined theme categories and for finding associated programmes.
<LI>Support for several new programme attributes defined by XMLTV was added,
  namely "review", "new", "premiere" and "last-chance". The "audio", "video"
  and "subtitles" attributes parsing was updated to support new attributes
  defined by XMLTV. (Note you'll benefit from these enhancements only if your
  XMLTV provider supports these attributes.)
<LI>Processing of parental and editorial ratings was enhanced by removing
  rounding to multiples of two and adding support for a Polish and an American
  parental rating category. For editorial ratings, the GUI now displays both
  the actual rating and maximum value.
<LI>The expiry threshold filter dialog was extended to allow disabling the expiry
  time filter completely, so that even programme data that is completely
  expired can be viewed.
<LI>Case-insensitive text search was corrected, so that it now also works as
  expected for text containing non-ASCII characters (i.e. locale-specific
  characters).
<LI>The limitation to 254 channels when importing a database from XMLTV was
  relaxed to about 8000 channels and the import procedures were optimized to
  reduce load time for huge XMLTV files.
<LI>Performance of several GUI dialogs was improved for large databases, namely
  the programme index filter and "Recurring titles" drop-down menu.
<LI>Usability of the "Load XMLTV file" menu command was improved by replacing
  this command with a standard file selection dialog. The previous more complex
  dialog was kept as a separate menu command "Browse XMLTV files" with an
  additional possibility to configure file name extension of XMLTV files.
<LI>Usability of the "Network name configuration" dialog was improved by omitting
  optional notifications and dialog sub-frames that are not relevant when
  nxtvepg is not configured to interact with a TV application.
<LI>When using MS Windows, the "nxtvepg.ini" configuration file is now stored in
  the user's "AppData" directory instead of the current working directory.
  Note this means that a config file created by previous versions of nxtvepg
  will not be loaded automatically.
<LI>Encoding of the config file has been changed to UTF-8 so that characters
  imported from XMLTV can be stored without corruption. If your system is not
  configured to use UTF-8 by default, it's recommended to delete your old
  "nxtvepg.ini" (MS Windows) or "config/nxtvepg/nxtvepg.rc" (Linux) file.

<P>
Your feedback is always welcome.  If you have specific questions, suggestions,
bug reports or any other kind of feedback, feel free to use any of the
following possibilities. Since nxtvepg currently has few users, you should
not expect bugs to be fixed unless you report them yourself.
