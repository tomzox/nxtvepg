<BR>Browser for TV schedules in XMLTV format</SPAN></H1>

<P>
Welcome to the homepage of the <I>nxtvepg</I> software package, a browser for
TV programme schedules (EPG) stored in <A HREF="http://xmltv.org/">XMLTV</A>
format. nxtvepg supports flexible merging EPG from multiple sources and
displaying the result in a compact table view, or a grid view. It supports
filtering the TV schedule based on a large number of attributes, a filter
shortcut list in the main window, adding custom columns to the view to mark
programmes matching predefined filters, and reminders for individual programmes
or filter shortcuts.
</P><P>
nxtvepg also features an integrated Teletext EPG grabber, which uses a TV
capture card for automatically extracting TV schedules from programme tables in
Teletext from a given list of channels. Acquired EPG data can be merged and
browsed immediately in the nxtvepg GUI, or exported to files in XMLTV format
for use in another browser. Currently, the list of
<A HREF="provnets.html">well-supported TV networks</A> consists mainly of
German TV networks. Support for other networks can be easily added on request,
provided they transmit Teletext with useful TV schedules.
</P><P>
<BR>
<I>History</I>: From 2000-2008 nxtvepg was originally developed for receiving
and browsing Nextview EPG, which was an European standard for transmission
of Electronic TV Program Guides within analog TV broadcasts. However, as the
world has switched to digital TV broadcast since, it is no longer transmitted
today. Therefore, support for this standard has been removed from nxtvepg in
release 3.0.

<H2><A NAME="releases">New release 3.0 (Mar/22/2021)</A></H2>
<P>
After 10 years gap in development, this new release strips features that
no longer are useful (namely Nextview EPG and analog TV driver for Windows),
but improves support for those features that still work, in particular
import of XMLTV import and the Teletext EPG grabber. In detail:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Teletext EPG grabber was enhanced to allow reception from DVB TV
  capture cards (Linux only yet). Digital TV channel tables can be loaded
  from mplayer, VDR, or compatible TV-applications.
<LI>Capture duration of the Teletext EPG Grabber was reduced to a fraction by
  supporting concurrent acquisition from DVB channels sharing a transponder.
<LI>Use of Teletext EPG grabber was simplified via an "auto-merge" feature,
  available directly via the "Control" menu or the Merge dialog.
<LI>The Nextview-specific "series" filter was replaced with a new "recurring
  titles" filter.
<LI>The database and teletext statistics displays were enhanced to show the
  same extent of information as formerly for Nextview EPG databases.
<LI>XMLTV import was simplified by allowing to specify multiple files on the
  command line and directory selection in the load &amp; merge dialog windows.
<LI>The internal text for Text imported from XMLTV was switched to UTF-8
  so that it supports encodings used outside of Western Europe.
<LI>Nextview EPG support was removed, as this service is no longer provided.
<LI>The integrated driver for analog PCI TV capture cards on MS Windows was
  also removed.

<H2>Release 2.9.0 (Mar/22/2021) - Last release with Nextview EPG</H2>
<P>
This release mainly consists of enhancements done during the years 2008 to
2011, which at that time were only published in form of "pre-releases"
(2.9.0pre0 to pre4). On top of these, except for a few small corrections,
more recent updates only address issues with building the software with
current tools and using it with current Linux drivers. The reason for making
this release at the same time as 3.0.0 is providing one final version with
latest and greatest support for Nextview EPG before its removal from nxtvepg.
</P><P>
Refer to the <A HREF="changelog.html#release_2_9_0">changelog</A> for a detailed list of
changes of this release. Use this release only if you still have a Nextview
EPG provider (if so, I'd like to hear about it). You can download it from the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64430">SourceForge File List</A>.

Your feedback is always welcome.  If you have specific questions, suggestions,
bug reports or any other kind of feedback, feel free to use any of the
following possibilities. Since nxtvepg currently has few users, you should
not expect bugs to be fixed unless you report them yourself.
