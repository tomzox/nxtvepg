<H1>Nextview EPG Decoder Change-Log</H1>

The following new features have been added between release 0.3 and 0.4
of the <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.tripod.com">nxtvepg</A>
nexTView EPG decoder software:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Database Merging</STRONG>
<DD><P>
If you compare databases of different Nextview providers, you will often
find that each has one or more nice features, or covers networks, that the
others lack. Instead of changing back and forth between several providers
all the time, database merging allows to select and combine features or
networks from several original databases into one newly created database.
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Extended Acquisition Control</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Previously, acquisition always worked for the provider you had chosen
for the browser. If you were interested in more than one provider's
database, you had to manually select them one after each other to get
them up to date. Now, you can put your favorite providers into a list
and have them automatically updated one-by-one. There are several modes
that allow for a faster start-up time, e.g. by loading just the "Now"
data of all providers in a first pass (takes about 2 minutes each) and
afterwards the complete databases (takes about 20 minutes each).
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Browser listbox column configuration</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Previously the format of the programme listings was fixed. Now you have
the free choice which attributes you're interested in. Usually you'll
have at least the title, running time and channel name, and then add
whatever you need most often, e.g. the major theme (movie/series/show etc.),
rating, picture format, ...
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Support for other operating systems</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Last but not least, nxtvepg has been ported to NetBSD (many Thanks to
Mario Kemper, who's also my valued beta tester) and to Micro$oft Windows
(thanks to "Espresso", from whose MultiDec software the driver was derived)
</P>

Below is a history of additions and bug fixes inbetween releases:

<H2>From 0.4.pre2 to 0.4.3 (Feb. 2001)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed various glitches in acquisition mode handling and warnings
<LI>Added warning when acq mode is forced passive due to non-tuner input source
<LI>Finally added chapter about merged databases to documentation
<LI>Split off EPG scan sources from epgacqctl.c into separate module epgscan.c
<LI>Temp workaround for merged db statistics: supress unsupported categories
<LI>Improved presentation of merged descriptions: suppress redundant text
<LI>added transmission error handling: do not replace equivalent block with a
  copy with more parity errors (in the string segment)
<LI>Introduced EPG scan options "Slow" and "Refresh" for bad reception or
  database loss, respectively
<LI>Added OI header and message to provider selection popup
<LI>Network selection popup: added possibility to copy CNI order and suppression
  between providers
<LI>Added infos to README about Windows driver installation; thanks to Mario.
<LI>Browser listbox format now configurable: now columns can be freely selected
  from 16 attribute types, including title, time, date, theme, ratings, etc.
<LI>Added browser listbox column header buttons with drop-down menus
<LI>Fixed substring search with latin-1 chars: did not work due to new internal
  encoding in Tcl 8.3 (UTF8)
<LI>Fixed dynamic menus on Win32 (e.g. context menu, series menu, Navigate):
  Windows does not generate unmap event, hence the menu content always
  remained the same, regardless of PI selection or even provider changes
<LI>Fixed program crash on Win32 while error MessageBox was displayed via Tcl:
  crashed when the mouse was moved from the desktop directly into the main win
</UL>

<H2>From 0.4.pre1 to 0.4.pre2 (Jan. 2001)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Added status line below browser window for db coverage and acq status
<LI>Statistics windows now available separately for browser and acq databases.
  Added pie chart in addition to history diagram.
<LI>Acquisition statistics are now updated even while no EPG reception, to
  allow analysis of reception trouble. Added output of VPS/PDC CNI.
<LI>NetBSD: patch from Mario to fix possible hangup of VBI slave after an
  external /dev/video application is terminated.
<LI>Windows Bt8x8 driver: added PLL init for 35MHz; Improved driver start on NT;
  Fixed blue screen during shutdown and crashes: exceptions and the shutdown
  message are now catched and the driver stopped before the program exits;

<LI>compatibility with Windows driver version 4.00
<LI>updated registry hack for Windows Bt8x8 driver 4.31 and later
<LI>command line can take database path as last argument
  This is intended for Windows, to be able to drag and drop a database file
  onto the executable, but can generally be used to set -dbdir and -provider
<LI>added warning messages for database reload errors or missing frequencies
</UL>

<H2>From 0.3.4 to 0.4.pre0 (Dec. 2000)</H2>

<LI>fixed bugs in shortcut selection: series were not set in the menu checkbuttons
  and series filter not disabled in filter context after deselection

<LI>maintain list of "obsolete" PI, i.e. PI that could not be added
  to the db or are expired. This now allows to generate an exact
  statistic on how many blocks on the range given in AI were
  acquired.
