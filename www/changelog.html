<H1>Nextview EPG Decoder Change-Log</H1>

<P>
This document contains a list of all major changes between releases
of the <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.tripod.com/">nxtvepg</A>
nexTView EPG decoder software.
<BR>
It now also contains information about work in progress on the next release. 
If you're interested in beta testing new features, just send me a mail.
</P>

<H2>From 0.5.2 to 0.6.0 (yet unreleased)</H2>
<P>
The next release will contain the following new features:
</P><P>
<UL>
<LI>Dump of programme list or selected programme descriptions into a file
  in HTML format, from where they can be loaded by any WWW browser. This
  may be of interest for people who want to print out TV schedules
  onto dead trees.
<LI>New text search option <I>Match full</I> to allow exact title matches,
  e.g. a search for "heute" will no longer match on "heute journal" when
  full match is enabled.
<LI>internal change only: separated the EPG scan cleanly from the acq control
  state machine. This removes some pitfalls which were one of the reasons the
  last release was a week late.
<LI><I>and certainly more...</I>
</UL></P>

<H2>From 0.5.1 to 0.5.2 (June/14/2001)</H2>
<P>
This release contains two bugfixes:
</P><P>
<UL>
<LI>Bugfix programme listbox: the network filter did not follow xawtv channel
  changes. Thanks to Werner Renhardt (werner at kangaroo.at)
<LI>Bugfix cyclic acquisition (bug was introduced in release 0.5.1): expired programmes
  were not counted for acquisition statistics, hence sometimes the acquisition engine
  did not detect when the database was complete and did not move on to the
  next provider.
</UL></P>

<H2>From 0.5.0 to 0.5.1 (June/5/2001)</H2>
<P>
This release completes the integration of nxtvepg with
the <I>xawtv</I> TV application (UNIX only). Now you can not only switch the
TV channel from inside nxtvepg's TV listings, but also zap through the channels
with xawtv and nxtvepg's description will follow the currently tuned channel.
The program's title and running times will also be sent back to xawtv.
See the <A HREF="man.html#CONFIGURATION">manual page</A>, sections
<I>Xawtv connection</I> and <I>Network names</I>, for details
or see this <A HREF="screenshot-xawtv.jpg">xawtv screenshot</A> to see
the title popup in action.
</P><P>
<UL>
<LI>Monitor the <TT>_XAWTV_STATION</TT> property on the xawtv window and VPS/PDC
  (during EPG acquisition) to detect channel changes (new source module
  <TT>epgui/xawtv.c</TT>; communication with xawtv is now done directly via X11
  calls, and no longer uses the <TT>xawtv-remote</TT> utility)
<LI>After a channel change, optionally set the programme listing's cursor on
  the programme currently running on this channel and/or display the programme
  title and running time information inside xawtv, either in a popup, as
  overlay (requires xfree4 and the XVideo extension) or window title message.
<LI>Improved handling of the network name configuration dialog by addition of
  a "Closest match" (in the .xawtv station name list) button.
<LI>fix: during refresh, the cursor now remains on the same start time and network
<LI>fix: short info text view is no longer set to line 1.0 during every update
<LI>fix: possible crash due to reference to freed memory when acq timescale
  popup was open &amp; bad reception (block discarded due to parity errors)
<LI>fix: in cyclic or follow-ui acquisition modes when acquisition was forced
  passive on a non-provider channel, e.g. by a busy video device, acq control
  did not automatically switch to active when the device was freed.
<LI>fix: network name configuration: name selection from the provider listbox
  was handled incorrectly for networks which were not covered by all providers,
  so that another than the selected name was actually used.
<LI>Added support for multi-network channel names (e.g. Arte / Kinderkanal)
  to network name configuration: split xawtv station names around '/' and
  use all resulting segments for matching with Nextview network names.
<LI>Added support for Turkish charset in national option table; 6 characters
  which are not in latin-1 are replaced by their ASCII counterparts.
<LI>Fixed two memory leaks in the EPG scan and wrong handling of the EPG MIP
  entry, which slowed down the scan on several channels.
<LI>changed Makefile.win32 to use gcc/mingw32 for compilation. The supplied
  Tcl/Tk libraries are compiled with gcc too (on NT using cygwin)
</UL></P>

<H2>From 0.4.5 to 0.5.0 (Apr/21/2001)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The main window is now vertically resizable. The proportions of the program listbox
  and the info text can be adjusted with a "panning" button (slider).
<LI>Added a button called "Tune TV" in the main window to remote-control xawtv (UNIX only).
<LI>Added network name configuration dialog to synchronize names with the <I>.xawtv</I>
  configuration file and to allow consistant network naming across all providers.
<LI>Allow using channel assignments in .xawtv to speed up the EPG scan (UNIX only).
<LI>Added "Update filter shortcut" dialog to the filter menu to simplify changing
  existing shortcuts.
<LI>Made handling of filter shortcut dialog fool-proof.
<LI>Added filter settings description to the shortcut configuration dialog.
  Removed the filter combination checkboxes (were disabled anyway).
<LI>Added acquisition mode "external" for Composite/S-Video input source (or
  unknown win32 tuner types).  Win32: suppressed obsolete acq mode "passive".
<LI>Fixed command line option -rcfile for Win32: backslash chars in path vanished.
<LI>Restructured software to simplify reuse as library in other projects.
</UL>

<H2>From 0.4.4 to 0.4.5 (Apr/1/2001)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed bug in NetBSD daylight saving time handling, due to which programmes
  were shifted by 60 minutes. Thanks to Mario Kemper for the patch.
<LI>Fixed bug in Tcl proc LoadRc, due to which reload of the rc/ini configuration file could fail.
  Thanks to Dan Lindstroem for the patch.
</UL>

<H2>From 0.4.3 to 0.4.4 (Feb/27/2001)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Please note my new email address: tomzo <I>at</I> nefkom.net
<LI>Fixed severe bug in database reload (reference to freed memory;
  Curiously this led to crashes under Windows only)
<LI>Fixed compatibility with old bttv driver versions (versions &lt;= 0.6.x produced
  error "VIDIOCSCHAN: operation not supported" during TV channel changes)
<LI>Added detection of lost VBI frames (Linux, for debugging/optimization only)
<LI>Added frequency table for France; Minor fixes in Western Europe table;
  Tables can be selected via the TV card input popup.
<LI>Updated tuner type table for Windows Bt8x8 driver -&gt; support for new tuners
<LI>Implemented hyperlinks in help pages for references between chapters
</UL>

<P><HR><P>
<H3>New features between release 0.3 and 0.4</H3>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Database Merging</STRONG>
<DD><P>
If you compare databases of different Nextview providers, you will often
find that each has one or more nice features, or covers networks, that the
others lack. Instead of changing back and forth between several providers
all the time, database merging allows to select and combine features or
networks from several original databases into one newly created database.
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Extended Acquisition Control</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Previously, acquisition always worked for the provider you had chosen
for the browser. If you were interested in more than one provider's
database, you had to manually select them one after each other to get
them up to date. Now, you can put your favorite providers into a list
and have them automatically updated one-by-one. There are several modes
that allow for a faster start-up time, e.g. by loading just the "Now"
data of all providers in a first pass (takes about 2 minutes each) and
afterwards the complete databases (takes about 20 minutes each).
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Browser listbox column configuration</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Previously the format of the programme listings was fixed. Now you have
the free choice which attributes you're interested in. Usually you'll
have at least the title, running time and channel name, and then add
whatever you need most often, e.g. the major theme (movie/series/show etc.),
rating, picture format, ...
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Improved database and acquisition statistics</STRONG>
<DD><P>
(1) Database statistics are now available independently of acquisition,
and include new catagories, e.g. percentage of expired program blocks.
(2) Acquisition stats can be invoked before a provider was found, and
contain an regularily updated VPS/PDC and teletext reception summary,
to allow debugging of reception problems.
(3) Added a status line at the bottom of the browser window to give a
quick overview of the database and acquisition state.
</P>
<DT><STRONG>Support for other operating systems</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Last but not least, nxtvepg has been ported to NetBSD (many Thanks to
Mario Kemper, who's also my valued beta tester) and to Micro$oft Windows
(thanks to "Es/presso", from whose Multi-Dec the driver was derived)
</P>
