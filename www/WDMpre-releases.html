<H1>WDM Support for nxtvepg:<BR>alpha testers download page</H1>
<P>
This page lists the latest updates for the very first attempt to support
Windows WDM devices for <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/">nxtvepg</A>
software package.
The software which is available here is only intended for developers
and alpha/beta testers.  If you're searching for the regular release
visit the <A HREF="download.html">download page</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note:</B> currently there are two development branches: besides WDM support
there's also a <A HREF="pre-releases.html">2.7.0 maintanance</A> branch.
The two branches will be merged for release 2.8.0.
</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
The following pre-release contains the latest Windows release of nxtvepg
with WDM support, i.e. the option to use drivers supplied by your card's
manufacturer instead of the one which comes with nxtvepg.  Main goal of
development is to help Windows users who cannot use nxtvepg at all because
their TV card is not supported by nxtvepg's driver.  This is because
currently VBI acquisition in the Windows port of nxtvepg is based exclusively
on the <A HREF="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</A> "dsdrv4" driver, which
supports only cards based on Conexant BT878, CX23881 or Philips
SAA7134 (and even among these only the ones with supported tuners.)
Cards with chip sets from vendors which do not disclose specifications
to support open source driver implementations cannot be supported
this way.
</P><P> 
WDM support is useful for Windows users only.
UNIX users need not look further.
</P> 
<P> 
Please do also refer to the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=14102">mailing list archives</A>
and <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=217872">forum</A>
for background information.
</P>

<H2>Known problems</H2>
<P>
The following bugs/open issues are already known:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When initially selecting a WDM source in the TV card input configuration
    dialog, video source selection may not work (device is allegedly busy.)
    If that happens, just close the dialog with OK and open it again.
    After that the video input selection should work.
<LI>TV channel/frequency conversion doesn't work for all channel tables yet.
    If you live in Germany and have cable, you need to create a file named
    VBIAcqWDMDrv.ini in the same directory as VBIAcqWDMDrv.dll with the
    following two lines:
<PRE>
[Debug Behaviour]
ForceRFInput=c
</PRE>
    This file is also in WDMDebugPkgDDMMYY.zip (see download section below),
    including documentation and additional debug options.
<LI>The EPG provider scan must be run in <I>slow</I> mode (you can enable this
    option at the bottom of the provider scan dialog window.)  Even then some
    networks may appear duplicate in the scan.  If your provider isn't found
    due to this, try running the scan again, or use a K!TV or DScaler channel
    table and move your provider's channel to the first position.
<LI>Hauppauge PVR 250/350 cards are not supported yet.
</UL>
<P>
Other problems which were formerly listed here (i.e. "elaborate VBI slicer"
not implemented and dsdrv driver disabled) are solved now.
</P>

<H2>Tests feedback</H2>
<P>
This section gives cards and system combination currently reported as "working".
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Leadtek WinFast TV2000XP Expert on Windows XP and Windows 2000
<LI>Hauppauge WinTv PCI (Bt878 + Philips Tuner) on Windows XP
<LI>Hauppauge WinTv Go on Windows XP
<LI>Hauppauge WinTV PVR on Windows 2000
<LI>Hauppauge WinTV PCI (new series with CX23881 chip) on W2K: <B>works partly</B><BR>
    Appearently due to a bug in the WDM driver apx. half of the teletext pages
    are lost; but if you're patient EPG reception is still possible.
<LI>Typhoon card "Art.No. 90031" with Philips capture chip (SAA7134) on W2K
<LI>Almost any card with Brooktree Bt878 or Bt848 capture chip when using the
    free <A HREF="http://btwincap.sourceforge.net/">btwincap</A> WDM driver.
</UL>
<P>
If you want to provide feedback, please send it to Gérard, not to Tom
(for developers' mail addresses look in the SourceForge
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=64430">project member list</A>)
Please ask first if your card is already tested before sending large trace files.
</P>
