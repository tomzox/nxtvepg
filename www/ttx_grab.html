<H1>Teletext EPG grabber</H1>
<P>
This EPG grabber allows extracting TV programme listings in
<A HREF="http://xmltv.org/">XMLTV format</A>
from teletext pages as broadcast by most European TV networks.
The grabber works by reading teletext pages via a TV card from all
individual networks, then extracting programme title and starting times
from programme tables (e.g. in Germany usually pages 301-304) and
finally adding description texts from pages which are referenced in
the overviews.
</P><P>
The grabber can be used stand-alone, but is best used as addition to the
<A HREF="intro.html">Nextview EPG</A> grabber
nxtvepg (<A HREF="pre-releases.html#pre_rel_nxtvepg">version 2.9.pre4</A>)
which can also be used to view the programme listings in the generated
XMLTV files.  The grabber is integrated into the nxtvepg acquisition
control and can be activated via the configuration menus. The main intent
of the combination is firstly to compensate for the recent loss of several
<A HREF="provnets.html">Nextview EPG providers</A>
(such as German providers 3sat and RTL2) and secondly to add more
description texts to the Nextview EPG.  In teletext, many networks
have good descriptions not only for movies, but especially also for
weekly magazines, daily soaps or current events.
</P><P>
Since the grabber has to read each individual network's teletext stream
and many networks use sub-pages at least for descriptions, the
process unfortunately takes relatively long. For full EPG grabbing,
at least 90 seconds per network are required. There's a fast scan mode
which requires only 10-20 seconds per network in average, however in
this mode overview and descriptions may be incomplete if sub-pages are
used by the respective network.
</P><P>
For now, only nation-wide German networks are supported. For other
networks the parser will need to be adapted to different page
formats. That's because almost every network formats tables, dates,
times and descriptions slightly differently, so that the parser will
have trouble locating the EPG data among all the advertisements and
other content in teletext.

<H2>Download</H2>
<P>
This download is mainly inteded for users who want to use the
grabber stand-alone, i.e. without nxtvepg.  In this case you need the
<A HREF="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/doc/libzvbi/index.html">ZVBI library</A>,
see below.
</P>
<H3>Latest Release: Version 2.0 from January 9th 2011</H3>
<P>
Under the hood the grabber has been completely rewritten in the C++
language instead of Perl. To the user this is a benefit only insofar
as the grabber runs now slightly faster and Windows users no longer
need to obtain a Perl interpreter.
</P><P>
Additionally, many minor updates, enhancements and fixes both in
in overview and description page parsing were done. In essence, the
quantity and quality of the XMLTV output has been improved.
</P><P>
Note this grabber version in compiled into
<A HREF="pre-releases.html#pre_rel_nxtvepg">version 2.9.pre4</A>.

<P>
Note the grabber is no longer implemented in Perl, thus a compiler is
required to compile, unless you can use one of the pre-compiled-packages
below. Note the grabber requires the "libzvbi" library. For this reason,
compilation on Windows is currently not supported (use an
<A HREF="pre-releases.html">nxtvepg pre-release</A> instead.)
