<H2>Linux specific</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="linux_channel_switch">
    Q: How do I keep nxtvepg from changing the channel while I'm watching TV?</A>
<DD><P>
This is a problem which should only occur with <I>v4l2</I> drivers
(2nd generation of the video4linux driver API), i.e. saa7134 and cx8800
- which only support v4l2 - or bttv version 9.
</P><P>
<B>Explanation:</B>
The reason is that v4l2 allows multiple opens on the /dev/video device, hence
the old v4l1 trick of switching channels through the video device (which would
only succeed if no TV app had already opened it) does not work anymore. The
problem was already adressed early 2003 by designing a new driver interface
which allows background data harvesting applications to lower their priority
beneath that of interactive applications like TV watching. You can check if
your kernel or video4linux module supports that feature by looking for ioctl
VIDIOC_S_PRIORITY in <KBD>videodev2.h</KBD>.  However it took quite a while
until the new feature was merged into the main kernel line.
</P><P>
<B>Solution:</B>
Upgrade to nxtvepg 2.7.0 and linux kernel 2.6.2 (e.g. from
<A HREF="http://kernel.org/">kernel.org</A> or check your distribution's
upgrade options).  Experienced users may alternatively upgrade video4linux
by downloading the latest module releases or snapshots from
<A HREF="http://bytesex.org/">bytesex.org</A>. Caution: this may require
to patch your kernel, check out the <I>patches</I> section at the bytesex
site.
</P>
<DT><A NAME="linux_video_index">
    Q: How do I tell nxtvepg to switch channels via /dev/video1
       while my VBI device is /dev/vbi0?</A>
<DD><P>
The problem occurs when your first video device does not support VBI.
Subsequent video devices will have mismatching video and vbi device
indices because the drivers usually allocate the first free device index.
</P><P>
nxtvepg uses /dev/video<I>N</I> both for the device scan (in the TV card
input configuration dialog) and to switch TV channels.  However for
Nextview EPG acquisition /dev/vbi<I>N</I> is used.   nxtvepg will only
work properly if video and vbi devices which refer to the hardware which
you want to use for acquisition have the same index <I>N</I>.  There is no
way to change that, however you can avoid the problem as explained below.
</P><P>
<B>Solution:</B>
Force the driver to assign device index #1 to the VBI device.
This is possible for video4linux drivers
by using <KBD>modprobe</KBD> parameters in <KBD>/etc/modules.conf</KBD>,
e.g. for bttv:
</P>

options bttv video_nr=1 vbi_nr=1

<H2>Windows specific</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="win32_card_config">
    Q: My TV card does not work. Help?</A>
<DD><P>
Unfortunately it's not possible to provide help for a question like this
one, because it fails to provide any context.  Remember the person(s)
who you're asking are doing this on a voluntary basis in their spare
time, so you should not put the additional burden onto them to guess
what you might have been referring to with your question.  Also consider
that any time spent on support cannot be used to implement or improve
features.
</P><P>
The minimum information you should provide is
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Your operating system, including version (e.g. "Windows ME")
<LI>Your TV card brand and model number
<LI>What did you already try to make the card work.  You can refer to
    the description in <A HREF="man.html#getting_started">Getting Started</A>
<LI>If there are any error messages displayed by nxtvepg, quote them
    <B>exactly</B> as printed on-screen.
<LI>If there are no error messages, please explain what exactly
    "does not work", e.g. is your card not auto-detected, does the
    EPG provider scan find no channels or no providers, or is a provider
    found but reception does not work etc.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Important:</B> You can save yourself a lot of time if you try to
find out which model and tuner setting your card requires if you
use <A HREF="http://dscaler.org">DScaler</A> (make sure to use a
version from the <I>alpha</I> branch, e.g. 4.19)  because it's so
much easier when you see a TV image.  If your card can't be made to
work with DScaler (excluding WDM sources, see below) it won't work
with nxtvepg either.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="win32_agp_usb">
    Q: Can I use my AGP card or USB box with nxtvepg?</A>
<DD><P>
Under windows no, you can't.  Only PCI cards are supported.
See also next question.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="win32_wdm">
    Q: Can I use my card's WDM drivers with nxtvepg?</A>
<DD><P>
As of writing this work on this area is underway, but there probably
won't be a release until mid-2004 (very rough estimate, not counting
unforseeable events which might even make the release not happen
at all)
</P>

<DT><A NAME="win32_cx23881">
    Q: Why does my "CX23881" based card not work although it's even auto-detected?</A>
<DD><P>
With cards based on the Conexant CX23881 (also known as Bt881) capture chip
there are still unsolved problems with interference between the dsdrv and
the vendor's WDM drivers.  These WDM drivers are known to access the TV card
even while no application is using them.  Note: You can verify that this
is the cause of acquisition problems by de-installing the WDM drivers,
reboot and then try nxtvepg again (note nxtvepg doesn't require any vendor
supplied drivers.)
</P><P>
<B>Solution:</B> none yet.  As of nxtvepg 2.7.0 there's an option in
the TV card input configuration dialog which allows to stop a vendor's
WDM driver for the same card.  However this is still experimental.
Feel free to try it, but be prepared that you have to manually re-enable
the WDM driver via the service control center in case nxtvepg fails
to re-enable it.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="win32_hardware_conflict">
    Q: Why can't I run nxtvepg in parallel to my TV application?</A>
<DD><P>
This problem occurs because nxtvepg accesses the TV card hardware directly,
but only one application can control the hardware at the same time.
<B>Warning:</B> Hardware access conflicts may crash your system, so you
should take care to avoid such conflicts.  If you mistakenly create
such a conflict, immediately quit both applications; especially do not
attempt to re-start capturing in either of them.
</P><P>
<B>Solution:</B>
If you want to run nxtvepg in parallel to a TV app you only have the option
to either use a <A HREF="links.html">supported TV application</A> or to
disable Nextview data acquisition while running the TV app.  The latter
can be done either at start time by adding the
<A HREF="man.html#options">-noacq</A> option on the command line or
at run time by unchecking <I>Enable acquisition</I> in the
<A HREF="man.html#control">Control menu</A>.

<DIV CLASS="box">
<H2>General</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="tv_app_interaction">
    Q: When will TV application X be supported?</A>
<DD><P>
nxtvepg already offers multiple ways for TV applications to interact
with it, hence it's generally up to the TV application's authors to
show some interest in cooperation.  In other words: first make the
TV app's author interested.
</P><P>
Also check out the
<A HREF="links.html">list of already supported applications</A>
</P>

<DT><A NAME="prov_missing">
    Q: How do I catch EPG providers which aren't found by the scan?</A>
<DD><P>
Fist make sure by reading the <A HREF="provnets.html">provider list</A>
that you really can receive the network where the provider transmits
and that it's still active.  Unfortunately there are many possible
causes which could make the provider scan fail, so there's also
different solutions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Some networks only transmit part of the day (e.g. TV5)  In this
    case you only can wait.  Also some providers have transmission
    gaps sometimes for technical reasons.  So be patient.
<LI>Load a TV application's channel table, for example from
    K!TV or xawtv (see checkbuttons at the bottom of the provider scan
    dialog window; note you need to configure <I>TV app. interaction</I>
    first via the Configure menu) and enable "slow" mode.
<LI>Tune the network manually.  On UNIX, just fire up xawtv or some other
    TV application and tune in the respective TV channel or frequency.
    nxtvepg will automatically try to find a provider on this channel
    in the background.  You can check <I>Acquisition statistics</I>
    (see control menu) for the progress; see also next question for
    info how to read the statistics.
    <BR>On Windows it works basically the same, but you have to use a
    TV app. which supports Nextview acquisition during TV watching.
    As of writing this it's only K!TV.
<LI>Last but not least, if it's not just one, but all provider which
    are missing, your card configuration may not be correct or signal
    quality too bad.  See manual chapter
    <A HREF="man.html#getting_started">Getting Started</A>.
</UL>
<P></P>

<DT><A NAME="acquisition_problems">
    Q: Nextview EPG acquisition suddenly doesn't work anymore.</A>
       Is provider X dead?
<DD><P>
Please check the <A HREF="provnets.html">provider list</A>.  If your
provider is listed as being active there, it's probably not dead.
</P><P>
As a general rule: try to remember what you changed since nxtvepg
last worked, and temporarily undo it.  This includes software
installation or upgrades, hardware configuration changes (new PCI
cards etc.) or changes in cabling (esp. TV antenna cables)
</P><P>
If this doesn't help, try an EPG provider scan.  If the scan doesn't
show any channels check your antenna cable again and check your TV image
quality and teletext reception (e.g. for missing characters or lines.)
Note that even if your TV image still looks sort-of OK, some kinds of
"systematic" errors will make Nextview EPG reception impossible.
As of 2.7.0 decoding statistics have been added to nxtvepg's "acquisition
statistics" (Control menu).  You can use them to analyze the root of your
reception problems:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Check acquisition status: if it says "passive" nxtvepg failed to
    switch to the provider's channel.  If the reason is "no tuner"
    you have selected an external source as input instead of the internal
    tuner, so you must make sure you have tuned a provider channel at your
    external source (e.g. SAT receiver);
    if the reason is "frequency missing" re-run a provider scan;
    if the reason is "device busy" stop any other video or teletext
    applications so that nxtvepg can tune a provider channel.
<LI>Check VPS/PDC label and network name: should display your provider's
    network name.  If not, re-run the EPG provider scan and check if your
    provider's network is identified at all.  If not, your reception may
    be generally too bad.
<LI>Check the teletext data rate: should be at least 150 kBaud for most
    providers (up to 230 kBaud for some.)  If it's much less your reception
    is too weak to receive Nextview EPG.
<LI>Check if EPG data is detected: the EPG page rate should be 1 to 1.5 per
    second.  If you don't get any pages although teletext data rate is OK,
    your provider may have temporarily suspended transmission. Try again later.
<LI>Check if "AI blocks" are received: usually one should be received every
    10 seconds.  If you do get a good EPG page rate but still no AI blocks,
    there may be "systematic" packet loss, e.g. the first or last line on
    every page missing.  Since AI blocks are very large and hence span many
    teletext packets, such losses can completely prohibit Nextview EPG
    reception.  If your teletext reception is otherwise OK, these losses may
    be caused by driver problems or sometimes by hardware problems (e.g.
    "overload" on a PCI bus, or interrupt problems.)  Check that you have
    the latest drivers, or try to move the TV card to a different PCI slot.
</UL>
<P>
Note if the statistics are resetted every couple seconds, i.e. the
acquisition runtime restarts at zero, this is just another indication of
decoding errors (i.e. nxtvepg falsely assumes there's been a channel change
when there are too many changes in teletext headers.)
</P><P>
If that's to complicated, feel free to ask in the forum, but make sure
to include an copy of the statistics output and describe what you already
checked or tried to make acquisition work.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="time_zone">
    Q: All times are wrong by one or two hours.  How do I fix that?</A>
<DD><P>
Dates and times in Nextview EPG are transmitted by the content providers
in UTC (<I>Universal Coordinated Time</I> also known as
<I>Greenwhich Mean Time</I> aka GMT.)  Hence to display them correctly,
dates and times need to be converted into your local time zone, which will
only work correctly if you configure your PC's time zone and daylight
saving time (i.e. summer/winter time) settings.  Especially after daylight
saving time changes you should not only change your wall clock time, but
also make sure your system's daylight saving time and/or time zone setting
have been adapted.
</P><P>
nxtvepg also evaluates environment variable <I>TZ</I>, which allows to
override the system's time zone setting.  Usually this variable should
not be defined, unless you know what you're doing.

<H2>Tips and Tricks</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="tip_attribute_composition">
    Tip: Using <I>Tages-Tipp</I> and <I>Movie-Star</I> categories
         provided by FAST-TV on Kabel1 in Germany</A>
<DD><P>
When you select provider Kabel1 and open the <I>Navigate</I> menu
(on Windows this is a sub-menu in the <I>Filter</I> menu)
you'll find two entries called <I>Tages-Tipp</I> and <I>Movie-Star</I>
which are editoral ratings by content provider
<A HREF="http://www.tvtv.de/">FAST-TV</A>.
</P><P>
You can copy these navigation entries into a filter shortcut simply by
selecting them in the menu and then calling <I>Add shortcut</I> in the
shortcuts menu.  You may want to remove the start time filter (e.g. "today")
beforehand by de-selecting this filter in <I>Filter->Start time...</I>
Afterwards you can use these shortcuts even for a merged database
(where you don't have a Navigate menu)  You can also use them in the
<I>Attribute composition</I> configuration dialog to mark the respective
programmes (e.g. mark highlights by adding a small yellow dot and movie
highlights with by a small red dot, like in this
<A HREF="screenshot-grid2.png">screenshot</A>)
</P><P>
Note this provider also makes extensive use of
<A HREF="man.html#filter types">sorting criterions</A>, but you have
to figure out for yourself which categories they are meant to represent.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="tip_xmltv_export">
    Tip: Restricting XMLTV export</A>
<DD><P>
To reduce the number of networks in exported XMLTV files, create
a merged database and remove unwanted networks with the
<I>Network selection</I> configuration dialog.  You can also remove
unnecessary categories (e.g. themes) by using the <I>Configure</I>
sub-menu inside the merge dialog window.  For example choose entry
<I>Themes</I> in said menu, then in the small dialog which pops up
remove all providers from the right list and press OK.
</P><P>
If you don't want to override your merge configuration when you
browse programmes inside nxtvepg, you can use a different nxtvepg.ini
or .nxtvepgrc file by using the <KBD>-rcfile name</KBD> option on the
command line when starting nxtvepg.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="tip_air_times_config">
    Tip: Air times restriction</A>
<DD><P>
For networks which you cannot receive the entire day (e.g. because
several networks share the same channel like Arte and France&nbsp;5),
you can configure a restricted air time in the network selection
configuration dialog, so that programmes which you cannot receive are
automatically excluded from the listing.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="tip_resources">
    Tip: Changing colors and fonts</A>
<DD><P>
There's no configuration dialog to change colors or fonts.  Instead
these options are determined from a <I>resource file</I> (this is a
concept of the UNIX <I>X Window system</I>) which needs to be edited
by hand.  Refer to manual section <A HREF="man.html#files">Files</A>,
section <KBD>.Xdefaults</KBD> for details.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="tip_database_sharing">
    Tip: Sharing databases and configuation between Windows and Linux</A>
<DD><P>
If you dual-boot your PC you'll probably want to use the same databases
under both operating systems, to avoid having to load everything twice.
By default nxtvepg stores the programme databases at different places and
with different file names under UNIX and Windows, however since nxtvepg
version 0.2.7 it's possible to load data which was acquired under the
respective other OS.  Just use the <KBD>-dbdir <I>path</I></KBD> command
line option to point nxtvepg at the right directory.  You can share your
<KBD>nxtvepg.ini</KBD> aka <KBD>.nxtvepgrc</KBD> file the same way by using
the <KBD>-rcfile <I>path</I></KBD> command line option.
</P><P>
Since you cannot easily mount a UNIX filesystem under Windows it's recommended
to use a Windows (FAT, FAT32 or network share) filesystem as shared directory.
Note you need read and write access to that directory, unless you're using
network acquisition mode only.
</P>

<DT><A NAME="tip_printing">
    Tip: How to print programme descriptions</A>
<DD><P>
nxtvepg does not support sending listings to a printer, however you can
export single programmes or entire lists into a HTML file and then load
the document into a web browser and print it from there. For details refer to
manual section <A HREF="man.html#item_Export_as_HTML">Export as HTML</A>.
