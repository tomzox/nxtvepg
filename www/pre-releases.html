<P>
Main focus of the current nxtvepg development is interaction with Windows
TV applications.  This feature is already included in the sources of 2.0.0,
however it has been intentionally disabled before compilation (i.e. "General
enable" in the TV app. interaction dialog is hard-wired to OFF.) because the
interface is not yet finalized.
</P><P>
The following ZIP file contains an nxtvepg executable that was compiled with
TV application interaction support and debug output enabled (you can use DebugView
by sysinternals.com to watch the message exchange between nxtvepg and the TV app).
The package also contains the tvsim, vbirec and vbiplay tools, but not the DLLs and
drivers; these have to be taken from the regular Windows release.  Documentation for
tvsim is included within the source tarball (nxtvepg-0.7.1.tar.gz) in the tvsim
subdirectory.  There's no documentation for the other tools yet.
