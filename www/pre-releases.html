<B>2.8.0 development line</B>

<P>
<!--
<B>Warning:</B> There's a change in the format of user-defined columns
in the rc/ini file.  Once you start 2.4.1 your configuration will automatically
be converted.  Make a copy of your old rc/ini file before you first start 2.4.1
to be able to switch back to 2.4.0 in case you find any severe bugs in 2.4.1
-->

Note the format of rc/ini file has changed in 2.7.5pre0 and 2.7.5pre1
(but not in 2.7.5rc1, which was forked off before 2.7.5pre0)
It will be automatically upgraded upon the first start when using an rc/ini file
written by an older version.  Remember to make a backup copy, so that you can
still return to older versions.

<!--
The acquisition daemon protocol has also changed,
hence you cannot connect with a 2.7.4pre0 client to 2.7.3 or older daemons, or vice versa.
-->
</P>
<P>
<B>Last update: March 24th 2005: release 2.8.0pre5</B>
</P>
<P>
As of 2.8.0pre1 WDM support (affects Windows users only) has been merged onto
the main development line, hence the jump from 2.7.5 to 2.8.0
</P>

<BR>Note: if you want to test nxtvepg with
<A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/README-proxy.txt">VBI proxy</A>
(allows multiple simultanuous VBI device users) then enable -DUSE_LIBZVBI in the
nxtvepg Makefile and get libzvbi from CVS at
<A HREF="http://zapping.sourceforge.net">zapping.sourceforge.net</A>.
<B>Important</B>: proxy support is no longer on the main branch. You have to
select branch "proxy" during checkout.

<BR><STRONG>Important:</STRONG> WDM users require a new version of VBIACQWDMDRV.DLL
    The one released for 2.8.0pre1 no longer works.

<LI>To enable use of vendor supplied WDM drivers you need an additional DLL which
    is developed separately by Gérard Chevalier.  Download from the

<H2>Change history</H2>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre4 and 2.8.0pre5 (2005-03-25)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Bugfix: missing error-check in time conversion lead to inconsistant
  start/stop times around daylight saving time switch (which lead to
  reload failure cause: "database corrupt")
<LI>Fixed timezone format in XMLTV output (DTD 0.5, local timezone only)
  Thanks to Laurent Garnier for reporting the bug.
<LI>Updated network ID tables for EPG scan and TV interaction (updated
  with TR231 rev. 03/2005)  Thanks to Quenotte.
<LI>Windows: Upgrade of Tcl/Tk library from version 8.3.4 to 8.4.9
<LI>Windows: Bugfix in new K!TV channel table import (Import "Test"
  in TV app interaction configuration dialog failed when tried
  immediately after switching from a different application type.)
<LI>Windows, WDM support: as work-around for broken Hauppauge drivers:
  removed VBI frame timestamp check
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre3 and 2.8.0pre4 (2005-02-27)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Added support for reading channel table of K!TV 2.3
  Thanks to Quenotte for providing a patch.
<LI>Windows only bugfix: "Record this show" did not appear in context
  menu when connected to K!TV
<LI>Improved network/channel identification by VPS/PDC during
  interaction with TV applications (e.g. TV5 was not identified)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre2a and 2.8.0pre3 (2005-02-20)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed error message during provider removal in EPG scan
<LI>Windows only: fixed !wintv! keyword handling in scripts bound
  to reminder events (this was already supposed to be in 2.7.4 but
  lost somehow)
<LI>Windows only: minor bugfixes in WDM driver support
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre1 and 2.8.0pre2a (2005-01-21)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>UNIX: Implemented new communication protocol for TV applications:
  based on the <A HREF="xiccc-proto.html">X11 ICCCM protocol</A>
  (Download the tvsim package to get a demo)
<LI>added command line option -remctrl for UNIX (was supported on WIN32 only)
<LI>Win32: keep acquisition disabled until the user has configured the TV card
<LI>Win32 (2.8.0pre2a): temporarily disable acquisition while in the TV card config
  dialog when switching to a WDM source (necessary to allow video input selection)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.5pre1 and 2.8.0pre1 (2005-01-16)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>WIN32: merged support for WDM driver previously released as 2.8.0pre0
  (Note: requires separate DLL, see page; still in alpha testing state;
  details see <A HREF="WDMpre-releases.html">WDM support development</A> page)
<LI>Included small fixes previously supplied as patch for 2.7.5pre1:
   <UL>
   <LI>Fixed -outfile option for Windows
   <LI>Win32-only: fixed bug during daemon start via GUI
   <LI>nxtvepgd: some memory was not freed during exit which triggered a debug exception
   <LI>Added description for -provscan in manual, added Belgium to country code list
   </UL>
<LI>Suppress warning about missing nxtvepg.ini file when nxtvepg is
  started for the first time.  Thanks to Gérard for pointing out this bug.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.5pre0 and 2.7.5pre1 (2005-01-08)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Split up config file .nxtvepgrc/nxtvepg.ini into sections.  Only
  sections belonging to GUI are parsed by Tcl code; sections containing
  database and acquisition parameters are read by a new C module.
<LI>Added new command line option -provscan de|fr|at|ch: runs an EPG
  scan without GUI. It can also be used by nxtvepgd, so nxtvepg can
  now be set up without ever using the GUI (except for some advanced
  acquisition options)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.4 and 2.7.5pre0 (2005-01-01)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed HTML export (not all text format options were processed,
  weekday color column was not implemented) and improved layout
<LI>XML export: format can now be selected via command line options
<LI>Added command line option -outfile <path>
<LI>Possibility to compile separate daemon without GUI (note to UNIX
  users: enter "make daemon" to compile the daemon-only executable)
</UL>
