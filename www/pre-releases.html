<H3>2.8.0 development line</H3>

<P>
The latest release is 2.8.0,
available on the regular <A HREF="download.html">download</A> page.
</P>

<!--
<B>Warning:</B> There's a change in the format of user-defined columns
in the rc/ini file.  Once you start 2.4.1 your configuration will automatically
be converted.  Make a copy of your old rc/ini file before you first start 2.4.1
to be able to switch back to 2.4.0 in case you find any severe bugs in 2.4.1
-->

<!--
<P>
Note the format of rc/ini file has changed several times during pre-releases,
the last time in <B>2.8.0pre17</B>.  The file will be automatically upgraded upon
the first start when using an rc/ini file written by an older version.
Remember to make a backup copy, so that you can still return to older versions.
Also note that the protocol in-between the nxtvepg client and daemon has
changed multiple times, hence use the same version of nxtvepg both on client
and server side.

The acquisition daemon protocol has also changed,
hence you cannot connect with a 2.7.4pre0 client to 2.7.3 or older daemons, or vice versa.

<H2><A NAME="wdm_if_lib">WDM Support for nxtvepg</A></H2>
<P>
The WDM interface library was developed by Gerard Chevalier in 2004-2005.
Gerard has stopped development on this project since then.
The library is currently supported by Tom Zoerner (as far as possible)
</P><P>
The following package contains the last release of the WDM interface
library for Windows. It allows Windows users to optionally use drivers
supplied by their card's manufacturer instead of the one which comes
with nxtvepg.
</P><P>
Main goal of development is to help Windows users who cannot use nxtvepg at all because
their TV card is not supported by nxtvepg's driver.  This is because
currently VBI acquisition in the Windows port of nxtvepg is based exclusively
on the <A HREF="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</A> "dsdrv4" driver, which
supports only cards based on Conexant BT878, CX23881 or Philips
SAA7134 (and even among these only the ones with supported tuners.)
Cards with chip sets from vendors which do not disclose specifications
to support open source driver implementations cannot be supported
this way.
</P><P> 
WDM support is useful for <B>Windows users only.</B>
UNIX users need not look further.
</P>

<P>
Unpack the ZIP archive into the same directory as nxtvepg,
i.e. the DLL should be in the same directory as nxtvepg.exe.
Additional instructions see README-WDM.txt in the zip file.
</P><P>
<B>Important note:</B> To use the library you need version 70d
of the Microsoft Visual C run-time library (i.e. <KBD>msvcr70d.dll</KBD>)
For legal reasons it is not included here. There are however plenty of
sources for it on the web, you can

<H3>Known problems</H3>
<P>
The following bugs/open issues are already known:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When initially selecting a WDM source in the TV card input configuration
    dialog, video source selection may not work (device is allegedly busy.)
    If that happens, just close the dialog with OK and open it again.
    After that the video input selection should work.
<LI>TV channel/frequency conversion doesn't work for all channel tables yet.
    If you live in Germany and have cable, you need to have a file named
    VBIAcqWDMDrv.ini in the same directory as VBIAcqWDMDrv.dll with the
    following two lines:
<PRE>
[Debug Behaviour]
ForceRFInput=c
</PRE>
    This file is already included in the package.
<LI>The EPG provider scan must be run in <I>slow</I> mode (you can enable this
    option at the bottom of the provider scan dialog window.)  Even then some
    networks may appear duplicate in the scan.  If your provider isn't found
    due to this, try running the scan again, or use a K!TV or DScaler channel
    table and move your provider's channel to the first position.
<LI>Hauppauge PVR 250/350 cards are not supported yet.

<H2><A NAME="ttx_grabber">Teletext EPG grabber</A></H2>
<P>
Currently a new grabber is under development which allows to
extract programme listings from
teletext pages.  The intention is firstly to compensate for the
loss of two German Nextview providers and secondly to add more
and longer descriptions to the EPG.  In teletext, many networks
have good descriptions not only for movies, but esp. also for
weekly magazines, daily soaps or current events.  The output
of the teletext grabber can be merged with Nextview EPG data
with the help of XMLTV import.
</P>
<H3>Download latest release: November 13th 2006</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Teletext grabber:
    <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/tv_grab_ttx-0.7.tar.gz">tv_grab_ttx-0.7.tar.gz</A> (apx. 25 kB)
<LI>Perl module Video::Capture::zvbi
    <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/Video-Capture-zvbi-0.1.tar.gz">Video-Capture-zvbi-0.1.tar.gz</A> (apx. 25 kB)
</UL>
<P>
The following is a usage example: First the channel is switched to network
ARD using xawtv's tool v4lctl. Then VBI data is captured for 1.5 minutes
into a temporary file.  After that EPG data is extracted from the captured
teletext data into an XMLTV file.  Steps 1-3 can be repeated for several
networks. Finally the XMLTV files are merged into a single file, which
can be imported into nxtvepg. See also <KBD>capall.pl</KBD>
</P>
<PRE>
  v4lctl -c /dev/vbi0 setstation ARD
  perl cap.pl -dev /dev/vbi0 -duration 90 &gt; ARD.ttx
  perl ttxacq.pl -page 301-309 ARD.ttx &gt; ARD.xml
  perl merge.pl *.xml &gt; ~/all.xml
</PRE>
<P>
For additional options see sub ParseArgv in either script. As you
can see VBI capturing is currently done via
<A HREF="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/doc/libzvbi/index.html">libzvbi</A>,
so <B>only Linux is supported</B>.  MS-Windows is only supported when
using the grabber via nxtvepg (see configuration dialog "Teletext grabber")
