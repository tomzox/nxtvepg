<!--
<B>Warning:</B> There's a change in the format of user-defined columns
in the rc/ini file.  Once you start 2.4.1 your configuration will automatically
be converted.  Make a copy of your old rc/ini file before you first start 2.4.1
to be able to switch back to 2.4.0 in case you find any severe bugs in 2.4.1
-->

Note the format of rc/ini file has changed several times during pre-releases,
the last time in <B>2.8.0pre14</B>.  The file will be automatically upgraded upon
the first start when using an rc/ini file written by an older version.
Remember to make a backup copy, so that you can still return to older versions.
Also note that the protocol in-between the nxtvepg client and daemon has
changed multiple times, hence use the same version of nxtvepg both on client
and server side.

The acquisition daemon protocol has also changed,
hence you cannot connect with a 2.7.4pre0 client to 2.7.3 or older daemons, or vice versa.

<H2><A NAME="wdm_if_lib">WDM Support for nxtvepg</A></H2>
<P>
The WDM interface library was developed by Gerard Chevalier in 2004-2005.
Gerard has stopped development on this project since then.
The library is currently supported by Tom Zoerner (as far as possible)
</P><P>
The following package contains the last release of the WDM interface
library for Windows. It allows Windows users to optionally use drivers
supplied by their card's manufacturer instead of the one which comes
with nxtvepg.
</P><P>
Main goal of development is to help Windows users who cannot use nxtvepg at all because
their TV card is not supported by nxtvepg's driver.  This is because
currently VBI acquisition in the Windows port of nxtvepg is based exclusively
on the <A HREF="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</A> "dsdrv4" driver, which
supports only cards based on Conexant BT878, CX23881 or Philips
SAA7134 (and even among these only the ones with supported tuners.)
Cards with chip sets from vendors which do not disclose specifications
to support open source driver implementations cannot be supported
this way.
</P><P> 
WDM support is useful for <B>Windows users only.</B>
UNIX users need not look further.

<B>Important note:</B> To use the library you need version 70d

<H3>Known problems</H3>
<P>
The following bugs/open issues are already known:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When initially selecting a WDM source in the TV card input configuration
    dialog, video source selection may not work (device is allegedly busy.)
    If that happens, just close the dialog with OK and open it again.
    After that the video input selection should work.
<LI>TV channel/frequency conversion doesn't work for all channel tables yet.
    If you live in Germany and have cable, you need to have a file named
    VBIAcqWDMDrv.ini in the same directory as VBIAcqWDMDrv.dll with the
    following two lines:
<PRE>
[Debug Behaviour]
ForceRFInput=c
</PRE>
    This file is already included in the package.
<LI>The EPG provider scan must be run in <I>slow</I> mode (you can enable this
    option at the bottom of the provider scan dialog window.)  Even then some
    networks may appear duplicate in the scan.  If your provider isn't found
    due to this, try running the scan again, or use a K!TV or DScaler channel
    table and move your provider's channel to the first position.
<LI>Hauppauge PVR 250/350 cards are not supported yet.

<H2><A NAME="ttx_grabber">Teletext EPG grabber</A></H2>
<P>
Currently a new grabber is under development which allows to
extract programme listings from
teletext pages.  The intention is firstly to compensate for the
loss of two German Nextview providers and secondly to add more
and longer descriptions to the EPG.  In teletext, many networks
have good descriptions not only for movies, but esp. also for
weekly magazines, daily soaps or current events.  The output
of the teletext grabber can be merged with Nextview EPG data
with the help of XMLTV import.
</P>
<H3>Download latest release: November 13th 2006</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Teletext grabber:
    <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/tv_grab_ttx-0.7.tar.gz">tv_grab_ttx-0.7.tar.gz</A> (apx. 25 kB)
<LI>Perl module Video::Capture::zvbi
    <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/Video-Capture-zvbi-0.1.tar.gz">Video-Capture-zvbi-0.1.tar.gz</A> (apx. 25 kB)
</UL>
<P>
The following is a usage example: First the channel is switched to network
ARD using xawtv's tool v4lctl. Then VBI data is captured for 1.5 minutes
into a temporary file.  After that EPG data is extracted from the captured
teletext data into an XMLTV file.  Steps 1-3 can be repeated for several
networks. Finally the XMLTV files are merged into a single file, which
can be imported into nxtvepg. See also <KBD>capall.pl</KBD>
</P>
<PRE>
  v4lctl -c /dev/vbi0 setstation ARD
  perl cap.pl -dev /dev/vbi0 -duration 90 &gt; ARD.ttx
  perl ttxacq.pl -page 301-309 ARD.ttx &gt; ARD.xml
  perl merge.pl *.xml &gt; ~/all.xml
</PRE>
<P>
For additional options see sub ParseArgv in either script. As you
can see VBI capturing is currently done via
<A HREF="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/doc/libzvbi/index.html">libzvbi</A>,
so <B>only Linux is supported</B>.  MS-Windows is only supported when
using the grabber via nxtvepg (see configuration dialog "Teletext grabber")

<!--
<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre16 and 2.8.0pre17 (2007-01-21)</H3>
<UL>
</UL>
-->

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre15 and 2.8.0pre16 (2006-12-28)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Teletext grabber: improved robustness for channels with high
    decoding error rate (i.e. improved teletext header text based
    channel change detection)
<LI>Linux: improved portability of timezone offset calculation
<LI>Added English translation of the teletext grabber documentation
<LI>Windows: TV-card driver update (merged once again from DScaler.)
    Most noteable changes: Added support for TV cards with TDA8275/8290
    tuner; Driver-adaption for 64-bit platforms
<LI>Bugfix XMLTV import: default VPS/PDC code was incorrect (caused for
    example reminders to by applied for all programmes of a network
    instead of the one programme where it was set on.)
<LI>UNIX: Added channel table parser for TV application "tvtime"
<LI>UNIX: minor bugfixes in support for libzvbi; also updated the
    DVB patch
<LI>Much internal clean-up (committed many recent and not-so-recent
    changes to version control system)
<LI>Backport of fixes and improvements made in 2006 to the nxtvepg
    "stable" line, i.e. version 2.7.7 (this only has an effect on the
    changelog in 2.8.0)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre14 and 2.8.0pre15 (2006-11-22)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Bugfix in -merge function of teletext grabber Perl script which
    caused every 2nd new programme to be dropped.
<LI>Bugfix in teletext acquisition control which could cause an infinit
    loop of database merging (i.e. 100% CPU load) when the GUI was
    displaying a database merged from Nextview EPG and teletext sources.
<LI>Fixed the Perl script so that it doesn't cause huge RAM and CPU
    consumption when getting fed input with decoding errors in
    teletext sub-page numbers.
<LI>Improved the provider merge so that it allows for slight variations
    in start times between provider databases. Note this required
    essentially a complete redesign of essential parts of the merge
    algorithm (which was almost unchanged for 5 years and very stable),
    so please report any misbehaviour.
<LI>Improved acquisition statistics: teletext data rate is now
    calculated with a running average filter instead of a plain average
    across the total acquisition runtime.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre13 and 2.8.0pre14 (2006-11-12)</H3>
<P>

    (Use "Acquisition mode" configuration dialog to enable this mode)
<LI>Improved merge of XMLTV files (make sure already available
    programme descriptions aren't lost)
<LI>Implemented handling of "passive" and "forced passive" modes in
    teletext grabber (i.e. external channel changes, e.g by a TV app)
<LI>Added progress output (i.e. percentage of covered channels)
    in status line during "Now" phase in Nextview EPG acquisition.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre12 and 2.8.0pre13 (2006-10-15)</H3>
<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Fixed error message during provider removal in EPG scan
<LI>Windows only: fixed !wintv! keyword handling in scripts bound

</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.0pre1 and 2.8.0pre2a (2005-01-21)</H3>

  based on the <A HREF="xiccc-proto.html">X11 ICCCM protocol</A>
  (Download the tvsim package to get a demo)
<LI>added command line option -remctrl for UNIX (was supported on WIN32 only)
<LI>Win32: keep acquisition disabled until the user has configured the TV card
<LI>Win32 (2.8.0pre2a): temporarily disable acquisition while in the TV card config
  dialog when switching to a WDM source (necessary to allow video input selection)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.5pre1 and 2.8.0pre1 (2005-01-16)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>WIN32: merged support for WDM driver previously released as 2.8.0pre0
  (Note: requires separate DLL, see page; still in alpha testing state;
  details see <A HREF="WDMpre-releases.html">WDM support development</A> page)
<LI>Included small fixes previously supplied as patch for 2.7.5pre1:
   <UL>
   <LI>Fixed -outfile option for Windows
   <LI>Win32-only: fixed bug during daemon start via GUI
   <LI>nxtvepgd: some memory was not freed during exit which triggered a debug exception
   <LI>Added description for -provscan in manual, added Belgium to country code list

<LI>Suppress warning about missing nxtvepg.ini file when nxtvepg is
  started for the first time.  Thanks to Gérard for pointing out this bug.

<UL>
<LI>Split up config file .nxtvepgrc/nxtvepg.ini into sections.  Only
  sections belonging to GUI are parsed by Tcl code; sections containing
  database and acquisition parameters are read by a new C module.
<LI>Added new command line option -provscan de|fr|at|ch: runs an EPG
  scan without GUI. It can also be used by nxtvepgd, so nxtvepg can
  now be set up without ever using the GUI (except for some advanced
  acquisition options)
