<H1>Developers and alpha testers download page</H1>
<P>
This page lists the latest updates for the
<A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/">nxtvepg</A> software package.
The software which is available here is only intended for developers
and alpha/beta testers.  If you're searching for the regular release
visit the <A HREF="download.html">download page</A>.
</P><P>
The releases on this page include alot of internal consistany checks and
produce plenty of debug output.  Hence they should be used for evaluation only.
Please do not redistribute.
</P>

<BR><HR WIDTH="75%">

<H2><A NAME="nxtvepg_3_0_0">nxtvepg 3.0 development line</A></H2>

<P>
A new major release is currently under development.
This branch drops support for nexTView EPG due to lack of content providers and
instead optimizes nxtvepg for use as XMLTV browser and Teletext EPG grabber via
DVB capture cards. (Note nxtvepg does not support capturing from DVB for MS
Windows yet.)
</P><P>
You can download the latest sources from the
<A HREF="https://github.com/tomzox/nxtvepg">nxtvepg github site</A>.
Use the instructions provided in README for building the executable.
</P>

<!--
<P>
Note the format of the "nxtvepg.rc/ini" configuration storage file will change
with this release. The file will be automatically upgraded upon
the first start when using an rc/ini file written by an older version.
Remember to make a backup copy, so that you can still return to older versions.
Also note that the protocol between the nxtvepg client and daemon does change,
hence use the same version of nxtvepg both on client and server side.

<H2><A NAME="changelog">Change history</A></H2>

<H3>Changes between 2.9.0pre4 and 2.9.0pre5 (2020-Dec-23)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The integrated teletext EPG grabber was upgraded to version tv_grab_ttx-2.2:
  This version include updates and enhancements to scraping of EPG data from
  teletext pages.
<LI>A major bug in XMLTV import was fixed, that caused spurious gaps in EPG
  coverage (i.e. by dropping programme items with no description text).
<LI>A bug was fixed that caused a crash when merging a very large number of
  XMLTV files.
<LI>The Linux driver interface was updated to remove remaining use of the
  "v4l1" interface ("video for Linux", API version 1), so that channel changes
  work with device drivers supporting v4l2 only.
<LI>Several bugs in usage of the ZBI library were fixed (only used when switch
  USE_LIBZVBI is enabled in the Makefile) that caused "forced passive mode".
<LI>Network identification tables were updated according to latest ETSI specs.
<LI>Sources were adapted to compile without errors or warning with latest
  version of tools. The dependency the "boost-regex" library was removed by
  using C++11 instead.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.9.0pre3 and 2.9.0pre4 (2011-Jan-09)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Teletext grabber: The need to an external Perl interpreter was removed by
  re-implementation in the C++ programming language.
<LI>Teletext grabber: The "Now &amp; Next" acquisition phase was optimized further
  so that in up to 30 networks can be scanned in 10 minutes.
<LI>Teletext grabber: There were many minor updates, enhancements and fixes
  in overview and description page parsing.
<LI>A new feature flag "HDTV" was introduced: for teletext or XMLTV sources.
<LI>The XMLTV export was updated to DTD version 0.5.56, which allow use of
  the "HDTV" and "audio:bilingual" feature flags.
<LI>XMLTV channel identifiers for "arte" and "das vierte" were added.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.9.0pre2 and 2.9.0pre3 (2009-May-03)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Windows: A bug which caused nxtvepg to lock up during auto-detection
  of SAA7134/SAA7133 based TV cards was fixed.
<LI>Windows: Bugs in the driver for TV cards based on the Philips SAA7134
  capture chip and tuner TDA8275/TDA8290 was fixed which prevented TV
  channel changes with error message "No tuner found on I2C bus"
<LI>Windows: handle power events (APM) to allow the system to enter standby
  even while EPG capture is enabled; re-enable capturing automatically
  upon resume
<LI>A bug in TV channel identification via VPS/PDC was fixed which sometimes
  caused endless toggling of EPG on-screen-display in the TV application.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.9.0pre1 and 2.9.0pre2 (2009-Mar-29)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The XMLTV export was changed to output channel identifiers which
  match those of other XMLTV grabbers as far as possible. Instead of
  part-numerical IDs such as "CNI1DC1" the export will now contain DNS-like
  names such as "ard.de" (the mapping is defined in file "xmltv-etsi.map")
<LI>The daemon was extended to allow simple remote queries for its EPG
  acquisition status.  A new command line option "-daemonquery" was
  added to perform such a query; a demo script was added to the manual
  to document the protocol and allow direct queries by other applications.
<LI>An acquisition timeout was added upon stalled reception, even when
  working on a single provider. This will stop acquisition when working
  with command line option "-acqonce".
<LI>A configuration option was added to the "Show/Hide" sub-menu which
  allows to hide the "Tune TV" button in the main window. (The automatic
  addition/hiding of this button upon attach of a TV application has been
  removed to allow for manual control.)
<LI>MS Windows only: The warning "Tuner not found on I2C bus" will now be
  suppressed if the tuner is configured as "unknown" as this used to
  annoy users with partly unsupported TV cards.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.9.0pre0 and 2.9.0pre1 (2009-Mar-14)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The "time scales" dialog was redesigned to allow scrolling vertically
  and horizontally (i.e. network list and the scales respectively.)
<LI>Windows: The TV card configuration database was updated (imported from
  DScaler) and a fix for cards with TDA9875/TDA8290 tuner was merged.
<LI>Two bugs affecting expire threshold handling were fixed, which prevented
  old programmes to be deleted from XMLTV files and kept expire time at
  zero for all merged databases.
<LI>The handling of all-expired EPG databases was slightly improved by
  alloweing to make the expired programmes visible via the expire time
  filter setting.
<LI>The "Tune TV" button in reminder message popup was enhanced to use the
  command specified by the user in "Configure -&gt; Context Menu / Tune-TV"
<LI>A bug in the protocol between nxtvepg daemon and GUI was fixed which
  sometimes led to dropped data on client side.
<LI>The obsolete "-demo" command line option was removed. (XMLTV import can
  be used instead where no Nextview EPG is available.)
<LI>Windows: The integrated Tcl/Tk library was upgraded to version 8.5.6 to
  benefit from bug-fixes and performance improvements since 8.5.0
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.8.1 and 2.9.0pre0 (2008-Oct-12)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Implemented a new command line option "-epgquery FILTER" which allows
  to restrict programmes during export via "-dump" (see manual.html)
<LI>Consistency checks were added for incoming "inventory" data blocks to
  increase probability to catch transmission errors and prevent "ghost
  providers" or corrupted network lists
<LI>Extended the EPG scan to include defective database files and providers
  with unknown TV channel frequency, so that a "remove provider" button
  is included for these too, although not actually scanned.
<LI>Fixed the "refresh mode" scan to include a match between found and expected
  providers so that a "remove provider" button is added for "ghost" providers
  which don't match the ID of the actually transmitted EPG.
</UL>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<H2><A NAME="wdm_if_lib">WDM support for nxtvepg (analog capture devices)</A></H2>
<P>
The WDM interface library was developed by Gerard Chevalier in 2004-2005.
Afterwards it was maintained by T. Zoerner.
</P><P>
The following package contains the last release of the WDM interface
library for Windows. It allows Windows users to optionally use drivers
supplied by their card's manufacturer instead of the one which comes
with nxtvepg. Note only analog capture cards are supported (i.e. no DVB).
</P><P>
Main goal of development is to help Windows users who cannot use nxtvepg at all because
their TV card is not supported by nxtvepg's driver.  This is because
currently VBI acquisition in the Windows port of nxtvepg is based exclusively
on the <A HREF="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</A> "dsdrv4" driver, which
supports only cards based on Conexant BT878, CX23881 or Philips
SAA7134 (and even among these only the ones with supported tuners.)
Cards with chip sets from vendors which do not disclose specifications
to support open source driver implementations cannot be supported
this way.
</P><P> 
WDM support is useful for <B>Windows users only.</B>
UNIX users need not look further.
</P>

<P>
Unpack the ZIP archive into the same directory as nxtvepg,
i.e. the DLL should be in the same directory as nxtvepg.exe.
Additional instructions see README-WDM.txt in the zip file.
</P><P>
<B>Important note:</B> To use the library you need version 70d
of the Microsoft Visual C run-time library (i.e. <KBD>msvcr70d.dll</KBD>)
For legal reasons it is not included here. There are however plenty of
sources for it on the web, you can
<A HREF="http://www.google.de/search?q=msvcr70d.dll">search for msvcr70d.dll with Google</A>.
</P>

<H3>Known problems</H3>
<P>
The following bugs/open issues are already known:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When initially selecting a WDM source in the TV card input configuration
    dialog, video source selection may not work (device is allegedly busy.)
    If that happens, just close the dialog with OK and open it again.
    After that the video input selection should work.
<LI>TV channel/frequency conversion doesn't work for all channel tables yet.
    If you live in Germany and have cable, you need to have a file named
    VBIAcqWDMDrv.ini in the same directory as VBIAcqWDMDrv.dll with the
    following two lines:
<PRE>
[Debug Behaviour]
ForceRFInput=c
</PRE>
    This file is already included in the package.
<LI>The EPG provider scan must be run in <I>slow</I> mode (you can enable this
    option at the bottom of the provider scan dialog window.)  Even then some
    networks may appear duplicate in the scan.  If your provider isn't found
    due to this, try running the scan again, or use a K!TV or DScaler channel
    table and move your provider's channel to the first position.
<LI>Hauppauge PVR 250/350 cards are not supported yet.
</UL>
