<H2><A NAME="wdm_if_lib">WDM support for nxtvepg (analog capture devices)</A></H2>
<P>
The WDM interface library was developed by Gerard Chevalier in 2004-2005.
Afterwards it was maintained by the author of nxtvepg.
</P><P>
The following package contains the last release of the WDM interface
library for Windows. It allows Windows users to optionally use drivers
supplied by their card's manufacturer instead of the one which comes
with nxtvepg. Note only analog capture cards are supported (i.e. no DVB).
</P><P>
Main goal of development was to help Windows users who cannot use nxtvepg at all because
their TV card is not supported by nxtvepg's driver. In nxtvepg versions 2.x,
VBI acquisition in the Windows port of nxtvepg was based exclusively
on the <A HREF="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</A> "dsdrv4" driver, which
supports only analog TV cards based on Conexant BT878, CX23881 or Philips
SAA7134 (and even among these only the ones with supported tuners.)
Cards with chip sets from vendors which do not disclose specifications
to support open source driver implementations cannot be supported
this way. Since nxtvepg version 3.0, WDM drivers are the only way to
use TV cards under Windows, as the dsdrv4 driver was removed.
</P><P> 
WDM support is useful for <B>Windows users only.</B>
UNIX users need not look further.
</P>

<P>
Unpack the ZIP archive into the same directory as nxtvepg,
i.e. the DLL should be in the same directory as nxtvepg.exe.
Additional instructions see README-WDM.txt in the zip file.
</P><P>
<B>Important note:</B> To use the library you need version 70d
of the Microsoft Visual C run-time library (i.e. <KBD>msvcr70d.dll</KBD>)
For legal reasons it is not included here. There are however plenty of
sources for it on the web, you can
<A HREF="http://www.google.de/search?q=msvcr70d.dll">search for msvcr70d.dll with Google</A>.

<H3>Known problems</H3>
<P>
The following bugs/open issues are already known:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When initially selecting a WDM source in the TV card input configuration
    dialog, video source selection may not work (device is allegedly busy.)
    If that happens, just close the dialog with OK and open it again.
    After that the video input selection should work.
<LI>TV channel/frequency conversion doesn't work for all channel tables yet.
    If you live in Germany and have cable, you need to have a file named
    VBIAcqWDMDrv.ini in the same directory as VBIAcqWDMDrv.dll with the
    following two lines:
<PRE>
[Debug Behaviour]
ForceRFInput=c
</PRE>
    This file is already included in the package.
<LI>The EPG provider scan must be run in <I>slow</I> mode (you can enable this
    option at the bottom of the provider scan dialog window.)  Even then some
    networks may appear duplicate in the scan.  If your provider isn't found
    due to this, try running the scan again, or use a K!TV or DScaler channel
    table and move your provider's channel to the first position.
<LI>Hauppauge PVR 250/350 cards are not supported yet.
</UL>
