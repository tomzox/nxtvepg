This release comes with internal consistany checks and debug output enabled
and should be used for evaluation only.  Please do not redistribute.
</P>
<!--
<P>
<B>Warning:</B> There's a change in the format of user-defined columns
in the rc/ini file.  Once you start 2.4.1 your configuration will automatically
be converted.  Make a copy of your old rc/ini file before you first start 2.4.1
to be able to switch back to 2.4.0 in case you find any severe bugs in 2.4.1
-->

Note the format of rc/ini file has changed in 2.7.4pre0.
It will be automatically upgraded upon the first start when using an rc/ini file
written by an older version.  Remember to make a backup copy, so that you can
still return to older versions.
The acquisition daemon protocol has also changed,
hence you cannot connect with a 2.7.4pre0 client to 2.7.3 or older daemons, or vice versa.

<H2>Change history</H2>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.4pre3 and 2.7.4 (2004-12-27)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed bug in handling external video input source during EPG scan
  which caused misleading help messages.
<LI>Finalized update of TV card support (i.e. DScaler import);
  bugfix in MT2032 tuner handling.
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.4pre2 and 2.7.4pre3 (2004-12-12)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Added possibility to configure text foreground colors (at least for
  programme list) to support an inverted color scheme (see examples with
  <A HREF="screenshot-inv-col1.png">inverted color scheme in single column layout</A>,
  <A HREF="screenshot-inv-col2.png">inverted color scheme in grid layout</A>)
<LI>Added new display format option for composite attributes (i.e.
  user-defined columns): set foreground color for entire column
  (see <A HREF="screenshot-inv-col3.png">example</A>)
<LI>TV app. interaction developent tool vbirec: added possibility to send
  commands and EPG OSD infos to a connected TV app (to allow testing
  this feature without nxtvepg)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.4pre1 and 2.7.4pre2 (2004-11-01)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>XML export: omit newline (i.e. line break) at start and end of
  description text (on user request esp. for DTD version 5); also
  in DTD version 6 descriptions merged from multiple providers are now
  exported in separate description attributes instead of concatenating
  the text into one with newlines inbetween.
<LI>Windows only: cleanly catch crash when switching desktop display to
  full-screen (e.g. upon start of some game); nxtvepg still aborts
  but safely stops the TV card driver and prevents popup message
  (the crash is caused by a bug in the Tcl/Tk library)
<LI>Windows: Fixed !wintv! keyword handling in scripts bound to
  reminder events
<LI>Windows: more updates of DScaler drivers (new TV cards, improved
  support for cards with TDA9887)
</UL>

<H3>Changes between 2.7.4pre0 and 2.7.4pre1 (2004-10-03)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixes in the way provider and network names were passed to Tcl/Tk
  for display in main window status bar and various dialogs (only
  relevant for names corrupted by transmission errors, but did cause
  sporadic failure)
<LI>Fixed default setting for context menu: was empty since 2.7.1
<LI>Fixed bug in text search filter for merged databases: sub-string
  search ended after 258 characters
<LI>Added work-around to catch "panic" (i.e. internal errors) in Tcl/Tk
  library, esp. to cleanly shut down acquisition
<LI>UNIX: added "XdTV" (former xawdecode) to internal list of TV apps
  with which nxtvepg can exchange EPG info
</UL>


<H3>Changes between 2.7.3 and 2.7.4pre0 (2004-09-22)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Bugfix EPG teletext number update in database: after external channel
  changes from one provider directly onto another there was a possibility
  that a wrong teletext number was stored for the first provider,
  subsequently causing acquisition to fail; also changed the EPG scan to
  update the teletext numbers stored in the databases
<LI>Added output of current EPG page number to "acquisition statistics"
  in control menu
<LI>Added possibility to store "expire time" filter in shortcuts
<LI>Fixed timezone calculation for provider "VT4"
<LI>Windows: updated DScaler TV card support; Note a new version of the
  dsdrv4 driver will be installed the first time you start nxtvepg
  (unless version 4.03 was already installed by another application)
</UL>
