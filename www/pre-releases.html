The following packages contain
a developer's snapshot of the ongoing development.

</P><P>Pre-release pre0 contains following fixes and improvements:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed French default shortcut "Météo" (did pop up an error message when
  invoked.  At first start of 2.5.1 the broken shortcut is replaced in the
  rc file; if that does not work remove and re-define the shortcut manually
  via the "Shortcuts" menu)
<LI>Experimentally replaced VBI (Teletext) slicer with code from libzvbi which
  performs better on channels with weak reception (UNIX and WIN32/Bt8x8 only);
  sometimes this slicer seems to eat up a lot of CPU (up to 25% on my 400MHz
  K6-2) you can disable it by commenting out -DZVBI_DECODER in the Makefile.
<LI>Improved resizing: status line no longer vanishes when reducing
  (however the window bottom now "jitters" during vertical resizing)
<LI>Allow horizontal resizing of main window when in "grid" layout (UNIX only)
<LI>Display warning about "lost changes" when the window is closed via it's
  title bar "close" button, same as with the "Abort" button
<LI>TV app interaction configuration dialog: added TV app selection for UNIX,
  to select which channel table to use, i.e. select between xawtv or xawdecode
<LI>Don't require existance of .xawtv for TV app interaction on UNIX
  <BR>Thanks to "Sir Pingus" for suggesting this fix.
<LI>Programme list can now be scrolled by dragging with the middle mouse button
<LI>Grid layout: added +/- buttons to control column count;
  <BR>Thanks to Thorsten for suggesting these features in the discussion forum
<LI>Disabled "Show column headers" option for the grid layout
<LI>Grid layout: refresh no longer brings scrolled-out elements back into view
<LI>Added French network "M6" back to the EPG scan's list of "known providers"
  and documentation.<BR>Thanks to Thierry for pointing this out first.
</UL>
<P>Pre-release pre1 contains following fixes and improvements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>fixed pre0 bugs in VBI decoder; ZVBI slicer is now disabled by default
  because it will not be in 2.5.1 yet
<LI>Major bugfix in grid layout: when scrolling horizontally one programme
  could be inserted into the wrong network column under certain conditions
<LI>Bugfix EPG provider scan in non-TV-app-assisted mode: channels without
  signal often were not skipped due to uninitialized variable (bug was
  introduced in nxtvepg version 0.7.2).  Thanks to Florian Zierer for
  indirectly triggering discovery of this bug.
<LI>UNIX: added new command line option "-tvdisplay" to allow communication
  with a TV app running on a different X11 server (e.g. a remote host).
  Thanks to Stefan Zoller for suggesting this feature.

<LI><P>Patch against nxtvepg-2.4.2 to add support for SAA7134 based cards with the
    Linux saa7134 driver version 0.2.2 and earlier.  Note that this patch should
    <B>not</B> be used with any later driver versions since it contains workarounds
