<H1>Software Developers Help Wanted</H1>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="marg">
The nxtvepg project is sort-of my pet project since 2000.  Development
was mostly driven by how interesing the topic seemed to implement, or
how much I liked to have it for myself.  Of course I also have honored
reasonable feature requests, but since my time is limited (I do also
have a job to pay for my living) and I'm a UNIX hacker and not skilled
in Microsoft specifics, I often see myself unable to comply to requests
even when wholeheartedly agreeing that nxtvepg direly needs improvements
in some areas.
</P><P CLASS="marg">
Since during the last year the number of users appears to have grown
considerably I feel a responsibility to address at least the most urgent
topics which I have listed below.  There are of course a lot more open
points and possible feature enhancements (see TODO list in the nxtvepg
releases), but those below also have the advantage that they can be
tackled without digging too deep into nxtvepg internals.
If you feel like contributing in any way to these, or if you think
there are even more pressing open issues in nxtvepg, please send me an
email (see nxtvepg <I>Help -> About</I> for my address).
</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Teletext acquisition via DirectShow &reg; on Microsoft Windows &reg;</B>
<DD><P>This is certainly the most important point of all, since many
    Windows users cannot use nxtvepg at all because their TV card is
    not supported by the driver.  This is because currently VBI
    acquisition in nxtvepg is based exclusively on the
    <A HREF="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</A> "dsdrv4" driver, which
    supports only cards based on Conexant BT878, CX23881 or Philips
    SAA7134 (and even among these only the ones with supported tuners.)
    Cards with chip sets from vendors which do not disclose specifications
    to support open source driver implementations cannot be supported
    this way.</P><P>
    A solution around this is to use vendor supplied WDM drivers via
    DirectShow. This is already implemented in DScaler and just would
    need to be adapted/reduced for nxtvepg.  This task requires a MSVC
    compiler though and a recent version of Windows with Direct X
    version 8 or later.  Since I only have Windows NT and cannot even
    compile against the DirectShow API, the prefered solution would
    be a DLL with an interface compatible with epgvbi/btdrv.h in nxtvepg.
    </P>

<DT><B>TV application interaction</B>
<DD><P>nxtvepg can only interact (e.g. display title info in OSD, see the
    <A HREF="tvsim.html#interaction features">tvsim manual</A> for a
    complete list of features) with TV applications which do support
    the interaction protocol; also it can only load the TV channel table
    if it has a parser for the specific file format.  Currently only xawtv
    and xawdecode on UNIX and K!TV on Windows are supported this way.
    On Windows in addition the channel table of a few more TV apps can
    be used.<BR>
    I do receive requests to suport one or other TV application almost
    on a regular basis, but I cannot do much here since for the most
    part the work is on side of the TV application;  I've already written
    a prototype client in the
    <A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nxtvepg/nxtvepg-2.6.0-tvsim.zip?download">tvsim package</A>
    which contains all the code necessary for interaction, but it would
    need to be included on side of the TV apps.  Please refer to this
    <A HREF="tvsim-faq.html">Questions &amp; answers</A> for more details.
    </P>

<DT><B>Linux VBI proxy</B>
<DD><P>The VBI proxy is an independent project which I've started around
    May 2003 with the aim to allow to run more than one VBI client at the
    same time (i.e. teletext, Nextview EPG, TV subtitles, Closed Caption
    etc.)  Development is based on the libzvbi library, which is part
    of the <A HREF="http://zapping.sourceforge.net">zapping</A> project.
    Nxtvepg users will benefit the most from this project since they can
    then run the acquisition daemon permanently in the background without
    disturbing any other programs.  See also my
    <A HREF="http://nxtvepg.sourceforge.net/tmp/README-proxy.txt">README</A>
    file for more details.  Source download is available from Zapping CVS.<BR>
    Now the core of the daemon, i.e. the actual VBI data forwarding, is
    already implemented, but the proxy will only make sense if it's
    supported by as many VBI applications as possible.  Pre-conditions for
    that is that the proxy API is well-thought out and flexible and of
    course enough users are lobbying for the idea towards other app's authors.
    I think I'll need all the help I can get with these.
    </P>

<DT><B>Translation for French and German users</B>
<DD><P>Appearently there is a number of users who do not understand English
    well enough to understand the descriptions in the manual.  The manual
    currently has more than 3000 lines but maybe someone still wants to
    tackle it?   At least in case of French this would not be a one-time
    only job, since the manual needs to be updated for every release.
    (It's also been requested in the past to translate all menus and dialogs,
    but this would be very hard since these texts are directly integrated
    into the source code and not in a separate resource file which could
    be replaced with different language versions.)
    </P>

<DT><B>User-interface improvements</B>
<DD><P>Not really an open point, but I thought I'd bring it up since I've
    received mail repeatedly along the lines "The nxtvepg user
    interface (on Windows) is so ugly, I'd like to help you to change that".
    Unfortunately it isn't as easy as that, since the GUI is based on the
    Tcl/Tk library.  You can't improve the looks much without switching to
    a different libraray (preferrably something portable like GTK or Qt)
    which would mean re-writing the complete GUI, i.e. some 20,000 lines
    of Tcl/Tk code plus a large percentage of 30,000 lines of GUI related
    C code.<BR>
    Still, if you have <I>specific</I> ideas for improvements I'm always
    happy to hear them.</P>
</DL>

<H2>Disclaimer</H2>
<P CLASS="marg">
Finally it should be noted
since nxtvepg is <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL Freeware</A>,
there's no money to be earned.  The users don't pay me, so I cannot pay you.
Unlike with some high-profile open-source projects, there also isn't much
fame to be earned, esp. outside central Europe where Nextview EPG is largely
unknown.

So I guess this opportunity is mostly aimed at people who code for
the fun of it, or for people who use the nxtvepg themselves and want
to improve on it.
