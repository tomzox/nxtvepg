    windows) to maintain different filter settings
- the main reason for the introduction is that it's simply prettier
- translated comments to english; reformatted to new design
- removed .hi header file (obsolete since vars are now in struct)

- added new filter type: network-prefilter
- same as netwop filter; separated to simplify prefilter handling
- prefilter disabled when netwop filter is enabled
- fixed theme 0x80 (series) handling:

    because 0x80 includes *all* series, hence the series filter would
    have no effect (logical OR)

    instead of 0x10-0x18
- also narrowed format: hex and ranges are no longer supported
    ProcessThemeSpec is obsolete
- slightly simplified DescribeCurrentFilter
- since netwop prefilter is now kept separatel from normal netwop
    filter we do no longer need to check for prefilter when uploading
    the netwop filters

- when last or first PI changes start time, removal failed
    because SearchPi for first or last PI found the wrong version
- hence a wrong PI was inserted as replacement
-> use new function SearchPiExact that also compares start time

- this is now done much sooner, in ui init
epgui/menucmd.c [rev:1.23, 2000-12-13T18:47:37]:

epgctl/epgacqctl.c [rev:1.27, 2000-12-13T19:11:28]:
- BI block is no longer added to the db
- instead only the app ID is saved in the context
- this simplifies the state machine: do not have to wait for BI in db
    (although the app ID is not saved before the 2nd acquisition, i.e.
    after a AI was received; but the app ID is not mandatory)
- bugfix AI callback:
- did lose tuner freq when reload for new CNI failed
- acq idle:
- moved check if acq is running here from main module
epgctl/epgmain.c [epgui/epgmain.c, rev:1.42, 2000-12-13T19:21:11]:
- bugfix: moved processing of DbSetDateTime & Acq events into main()
- reason: Tcl did execute idle events from deep, deep down the call stack,
    probably when waiting for windows to be destroyed by the server
- however the acq insert etc. funcs must NOT be called while other
    procedures are executed, e.g. an operation on the PI listbox must
    not be interrupted by yet another insert/delete!
- solution: just set a flag in the idle event handlers. the action
    is started from the main loop itself
epgvbi/btdrv4win.c [rev:1.4, 2000-12-17T18:36:57]:

epgdb/epgblock.c [rev:1.30, 2001-01-02T18:05:50]:
- PI_BLOCK: removed elems title_, short_info_, long_info_length

    before latin-1 conversion
- title string is now guaranteed to exist for every PI
    a 0-byte long string is generated if neccessary
epgdb/epgdbmerge.c [rev:1.9, 2001-01-02T18:07:24]:
- PI merge short/long info handling improved
- now add newline as separator between short and long info
- add form-feed between infos of different providers
- in the browser FF is replaced by a graphical separator
- also:
- removed title_, short_, and long_info_length from PI_BLOCK
- instead use macro PI_HAS_SHORT_INFO() et al. to check if present

epgctl/epgmain.c [epgui/epgmain.c, rev:1.46, 2001-01-06T14:06:47]:
- WIN32 fix: when db is given on command line, set working dir to that of argv0
epgvbi/btdrv4win.c [rev:1.7, 2001-01-06T14:08:09]:
- increased WinDrvr compatible version from 4.00 to 4.31
    since the driver aborts with "cannot lock card" with WinDrvr 4.00
- updated registry hack for WinDrvr >= 4.31 (from MultiDec 5.55)
- removed obsolete Win95 if-branch in Bt8x8_Open
    because there's no harm in opening the driver a 2nd time in WD_Open
- added explanations and reference to README.txt to all error message
epgvbi/btdrv4win.c [rev:1.8, 2001-01-07T19:48:49]:
- now compile with windrvr.h version 4.00 for backwards compatibility
    set WINDRVR_MIN_VERSION from 431 to 400
- fixed bugs for "passive" mode: input source and tuner are only
    set if expressly requested by the according config functions
    i.e. removed implicit sets in _Configre() and _Load()
- fixed bug in _Configure(): _Load() was called before _StartAcq()
    hence acquisition was not started because Initialized was already set!
epgvbi/windrvr.h [rev:1.2, 2001-01-07T19:53:49]:
- downgrade to version 4.00 from 4.32 for backwards compatibility

epgdb/epgdbsav.c [rev:1.30, 2001-01-08T20:43:50]:
- EpgDbReloadHeader(): improved error cause differentiation
- endian check only detected if it's the revers endian magic
- else: additionally check it it's an old-version header,
    which did not have an endian entry
- fixed reload cause EPGDB_RELOAD_ACCESS
- added errno check in reload function
- before this was checked only in the Peek function
epgui/epgui.tcl [epgtcl/mainwin.tcl, rev:1.54, 2001-01-08T20:47:50]:
- proc UpdateRcFile: removed special handling of acq mode "passive"
- this is now saved just like any other acq mode
- reason: passive mode is needed already during startup when the tuner
    is set by a different app before nxtvepg is started
README [rev:1.10, 2001-01-09T19:30:01]:
- added explanation of btdrv4win Warning: no tuner found on Bt8x8 I2C bus

- added note which MultiDec versions contain the driver: 3.5-5.5
- removed reference to manpage "Getting Started", since this now refers here

- because I really don't understand what I'm talking about there
nxtvepg.pod [rev:1.21, 2001-01-09T19:32:51]:
- corrected explanation of db command line arg:
- working dir is set to dir of executable too
- improved "Getting started" for Windows
- added note how "passive" acq mode can be useful for Win32
- when the tuner type is not supported
- refer to README for installation problems

- detection if Tcl is idle is now done correctly, by checking the result
    of Tcl_DoOneEvent(TCL_DONT_WAIT)
- sceduling of events is done in a queue instead of bools
- this is now used in GUI too when bg-messages or events are needed
